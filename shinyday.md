Work on group projects

# Final exam possibilities

Oral discussion

-   what have you accomplished in relationship to your initial goals in the class? (literacy, proficiency, fluency, expertise)
-   what have you learned from the other presentations?
-   what one thing that you learned in the class would like to share with us?

Oral or written discussion

-   what do you consider to be your best accomplishment in the class? has there been anything that you have learned in the class that you would like to share with us? (here, could be sent in the way of an attachment)

Written take home final for those who don't want to do an oral exam

-   Evaluate the argument that dog owners are happier than cat owners, using the GSS data, as discussed in class on April 8. Your report should be in the form of an R markdown document with a description of how you selected and cleaned the data, reproducible code with comments, and an interpretation of your results.
