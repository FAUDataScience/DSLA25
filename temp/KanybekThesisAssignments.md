PLEASE READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW TO THE LETTER! Ignored instructions or deviations, including minor (e.g. wrong font size) will carry significant penalties. 

Write the first section of your thesis. Some (most) of you may have to rethink your research question, revisit it's feasibility, reevaluate the focus (clarity/narrowness) of your central idea, and review the academic significance of your research (the 'so what' question). 

In this section, I will be looking for a well-motivated introduction and background. This is where your reader should get really excited about your paper and get impatient to read on. Some elements to consider:

- You may start broadly but be sure to narrow down to a crystal clear research question (which you must keep laser focused throughout the paper; that is, everything in the paper should be of direct relevance to this central question and readers shouldn't be left wondering why you're discussion this or that idea, definition, reference, example, or anecdote)
- Identify your goals: what is it that you're after in writing this paper?
- Clarify the importance of your topic. Why should the reader care? Try to engage the reader with an interesting anecdote or an unusual piece of evidence. Brainstorm compelling hooks.
- Set the context for your paper, such as a historical context or a discussion of topical relevance. 
- **As always, write well! Review, rethink, edit, rewrite and review again multiple times before submitting your work. It's painfully obvious to me when a submission has not been reviewed and polished by the author. Poor writing takes away from the overall reading experience and forces your readers to focus on the mistakes rather than the intended message or ideas.**

# Extensive review of academic literature

- **Due** Feb 21 by 11:59pm
- **Points** 150

- **File Types** doc, docx, and pdf
- **Available** until Feb 21 at 11:59pm

PLEASE READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW TO THE LETTER! Ignored instructions or deviations, including minor (e.g. wrong font size) will carry significant penalties. 

Provide a complete review of 20 ***most relevant\*** academic studies. Your sources must be academic in nature. Wiki sources, websites and newspaper opinion pages are not acceptable. Be sure to cite each reference properly (both in the body of the text and in the references section); Chicago style is preferred, but MLS or APA are also acceptable as long as you stick to one format. 

Importantly, your review should not only include the relevant findings of your cited papers but also be clear in ***how*** these sources are relevant (implicitly or explicitly). The reader shouldn't be left wondering why a particular was included. 

Organize your lit review logically (e.g. according to topics, competing points of view, chronologically or some other logical thread). 

Weave you literature review into a single coherent discussion that helps readers clearly place your paper in the existing body of research, instead of submitting a collection of loosely related paragraphs. Establish a gap (need) and highlight your (expected) contributions. 

**As always, write well! Review, rethink, edit, rewrite and review again multiple times before submitting your work. It's painfully obvious to me when a submission was not reviewed and polished by the author. Poor writing takes away from the overall reading experience and forces your readers to focus on the mistakes rather than the intended message or ideas.**

In this section, sum up your findings.

Start with briefly restating your research question and underscoring its importance. Revisit the "so what" question.

Offer a summary of your main points. 

Provide a coherent conclusion of your research findings. In other words, connect the main points of your paper. This is also where you would need to address if the goals of your paper were achieved or not. If achieved, how? If not, why?

If you have a call for action or policy recommendations, this section would be an appropriate place for such suggestions.
