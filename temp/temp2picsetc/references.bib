  abstract = {Systematically examines the effects of sample size and sample composition on the replicability of principal components. Using observer ratings of personality from the California Adult Q-Set, the author examines comparability coefficients in 192 series of principal components analyses using a total of 940 Ss. Results indicate that (1) once one has 20 or more Ss per item, the most comparable solution typically has as many components as items; (2) if these full solutions are ignored, there is still a substantial relationship between prescribed number of components and sample size when one uses either the .90 or .85 threshold decision rules; and (3) other criteria for determining the number of components to retain, such as the Minimum Average Partial rule, do not show the same relationship with sample size. Results indicate dimensionality cannot be inferred from component robustness, as these are empirically as well as logically separate matters.},
