## why a grammar of graphics?

If there was one conspicuous omission in last chapter's overview, it would have to be that of Leland Wilkinson, initially a psychologist, but ultimately a statistician who, [among other accomplishments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Wilkinson), developed a "grammar for graphics" which is the foundation for ggplot.

In our first language, our understanding of speech is (nearly) automatic, precognitive, seemingly easy.  Speaking, reading, and writing is akin to breathing; we don't need to know the mechanics of pulmonary function in order to do it.

Graphs, like language, are communicative tools. But graphs are not our first language, and 



Remember that data science is about uncovering the essence.

We speak, read, and write as we know how to breathe...

## r dialects

There are several approaches to graphics (and everything else!) in r; see [syntax cheatsheet](http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/Syntax-cheatsheet.pdf).  

The layout of this sheet is informative (one, two, and many variables X continuous vs categorical/discrete), and it provides a nice way of mapping out the domain. 

Base R includes one syntax for plotting which is still in wide use.  ggplot2, part of the tidyverse, is a second approach and the one we will consider here.see R4DS, Chapters 2 and 3

this will take two meetings



## ggplot

(see the **data visualization cheatsheet** on Slack)

Ggplot is a layered system of graphics. goal is to come up with some rules for good graphs, and a syntax with which to understand it

## playing with ggplot2

play along with Chapter 3

get ggplot2 to work

exercises 3.2.4 (what do you see?)

exercises 3.3.1 (a little further)

## playing with new data

get data - sources include https://github.com/idc9/stor390 and online data sets in R

pull out no more than five variables from the dataset

### 3.4 multivariate data

exercises 3.5.1
