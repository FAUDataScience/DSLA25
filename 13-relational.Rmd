# relational data

there are two sources which I will refer you to for now. The first is chapter 13 of R4DS.  The second is what Jenny Bryan describes as a cheatsheet, but is I think more than this (https://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html). This shows how the various "joins" of dplyr work in combining two tibbles (superheroes and publishers). If you want to get a feel for how combining data works, it is a great start.
