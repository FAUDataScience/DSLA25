<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> Pancreatic cancer</h3>
<p><em>Searching for back pain and then yellowing skin turned out to be a sign of pancreatic cancer; searching for just back pain alone made it unlikely someone had pancreatic cancer. Similarly, searching for indigestion and then abdominal pain was evidence of pancreatic cancer, while searching for just indigestion without abdominal pain meant a person was unlikely to have it. … a clear example of rigorous data science and computers teaching us things our gut alone could never find. This is also one case where the size of the dataset matters. Sometimes there is insufficient experience for our unaided gut to draw upon. It is unlikely that you—or your close friends or family members—have seen enough cases of pancreatic cancer to tease out the difference between indigestion followed by abdominal pain compared to indigestion alone.</em></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.2</span> Depression</h3>
<p>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a real thing. It’s evidenced in search data too.</p>
<p><em>In winter months, warm climates, such as that of Honolulu, Hawaii, have 40 percent fewer depression searches than cold climates, such as that of Chicago, Illinois. Just how significant is this effect? An optimistic read of the effectiveness of antidepressants would find that the most effective drugs decrease the incidence of depression by only about 20 percent. To judge from the Google numbers, a Chicago-to-Honolulu move would be at least twice as effective as medication for your winter blues.</em></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> The NBA</h2>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1.1</span> An empirical approach</h4>
<p>This is arguably a little weak, in that it is indirect.</p>
<p><em>It was suggested in a paper by two economists, Roland Fryer and Steven Levitt, that a black person’s first name is an indication of his socioeconomic background. Fryer and Levitt studied birth certificates in California in the 1980s and found that, among African-Americans, poor, uneducated, and single moms tend to give their kids different names than do middle-class, educated, and married parents…California-born NBA players were half as likely to have unique names as the average black male, a statistically significant difference.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="applying-decision-analysis-looking-at-both-types-of-errors" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1.2</span> Applying decision analysis : Looking at both types of ‘errors’</h4>
<p>In making decisions on the basis of imperfect information - such as <em>should we give chemotherapy?</em>, <em>should we accept this person into our grad program?</em> - it’s often useful to think in terms of a fourfold table, in which cells describe two types of correct decisions and two types of errors.</p>
<p><strong><em>The</em> miss (rough/no NBA):</strong> <em>Let’s look at the story of <strong>Doug Wrenn</strong>, one of the most talented basketball prospects in the 1990s. His college coach, Jim Calhoun at the University of Connecticut, who has trained future NBA all-stars, claimed Wrenn jumped the highest of any man he had ever worked with. But Wrenn had a challenging upbringing. He was raised by a single mother in Blood Alley, one of the roughest neighborhoods in Seattle. In Connecticut, he consistently clashed with those around him. He would taunt players, question coaches, and wear loose-fitting clothes in violation of team rules. He also had legal troubles—he stole shoes from a store and snapped at police officers. Calhoun finally had enough and kicked him off the team. Wrenn got a second chance at the University of Washington. But there, too, an inability to get along with people derailed him. He fought with his coach over playing time and shot selection and was kicked off this team as well. Wrenn went undrafted by the NBA, bounced around lower leagues, moved in with his mother, and was eventually imprisoned for assault. “My career is over,” Wrenn told the Seattle Times in 2009. “My dreams, my aspirations are over. Doug Wrenn is dead. That basketball player, that dude is dead. It’s over.” Wrenn had the talent not just to be an NBA player, but to be a great, even a legendary player. But he never developed the temperament to even stay on a college team.</em></p>
<p><strong>The false positive (supportive/NBA):</strong> <em>Perhaps if he’d had a stable early life, he could have been the next Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan, of course, also had an impressive vertical leap. Plus a large ego and intense competitiveness—a personality at times that was not unlike Wrenn’s. Jordan could be a difficult kid. At the age of twelve, he was kicked out of school for fighting. But he had at least one thing that Wrenn lacked: a stable, middle-class upbringing. His father was an equipment supervisor for General Electric, his mother a banker. And they helped him navigate his career.</em></p>
<p><em>In fact, Jordan’s life is filled with stories of his family guiding him away from the traps that a great, competitive talent can fall into. After Jordan was kicked out of school, his mother responded by taking him with her to work. He was not allowed to leave the car and instead had to sit there in the parking lot reading books. After he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls, his parents and siblings took turns visiting him to make sure he avoided the temptations that come with fame and money. Jordan’s career did not end like Wrenn’s, with a little-read quote in the Seattle Times. It ended with a speech upon induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame that was watched by millions of people. In his speech, Jordan said he tried to stay “focused on the good things about life—you know how people perceive you, how you respect them . . . how you are perceived publicly. Take a pause and think about the things that you do. And that all came from my parents.” The data tells us Jordan is absolutely right to thank his middle-class, married parents. The data tells us that in worse-off families, in worse-off communities, there are NBA-level talents who are not in the NBA. These men had the genes, had the ambition, but never developed the temperament to become basketball superstars. And no—whatever we might intuit—being in circumstances so desperate that basketball seems “a matter of life or death” does not help. Stories like that of Doug Wrenn can help illustrate this. And data proves it.</em></p>
<p><strong>The hit (rough/NBA)</strong> <em>In June 2013, <strong>LeBron James</strong> was interviewed on television after winning his second NBA championship. (He has since won a third.) “I’m LeBron James,” he announced. “From Akron, Ohio. From the inner city. I am not even supposed to be here.” Twitter and other social networks erupted with criticism. How could such a supremely gifted person, identified from an absurdly young age as the future of basketball, claim to be an underdog?

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1.3</span> The power of brute force facts: The effect of height</h4>
<p><em>How much does height matter? NBA players sometimes fib a little about their height, and there is no listing of the complete height distribution of American males. But working with a rough mathematical estimate of what this distribution might look like and the NBA’s own numbers, it is easy to confirm that the effects of height are enormous—maybe even more than we might have suspected. I estimate that each additional inch roughly doubles your odds of making it to the NBA. And this is true throughout the height distribution. A 5’11” man has twice the odds of reaching the NBA as a 5’10” man. A 6’11” man has twice the odds of reaching the NBA as a 6’10” man. It appears that, among men less than six feet tall, only about one in two million reach the NBA. Among those over seven feet tall, I and others have estimated, something like one in five reach the NBA.</em></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.1</span> Dreams, misspellings, and Freudian slips</h3>
<p>Freud argued that all behavior is meaningful and can help reveal the nature of the mind. Dreams, misrememberings, misspellings, and so forth are not random, but reveal the presence of (sexualized) unconscious motives.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.2</span> Looking at Freud 1: Phallic objects</h3>
<p>Stephens-Davidowitz argues that errors in writing and the reported content of dreams do not support simple ‘Freudian slips.’ One method is to look at the popularity of “phallic objects” in dreams, e.g.,</p>
<p><em>So what about phallic-shaped foods? Do they sneak into our dreams with unexpected frequency? Nope. Bananas are the second most common fruit to appear in dreams. But they are also the second most commonly consumed fruit. So we don’t need Freud to explain how often we dream about bananas. Cucumbers are the seventh most common vegetable to appear in dreams. They are the seventh most consumed vegetable. So again their shape isn’t necessary to explain their presence in our minds as we sleep. Hot dogs are dreamed of far less frequently than hamburgers. This is true even controlling for the fact that people eat more burgers than dogs. Overall, using a regression analysis (a method that allows social scientists to tease apart the impact of multiple factors) across all fruits and vegetables, I found that a food’s being shaped like a phallus did not give it more likelihood of appearing in dreams than would be expected by its popularity. This theory of Freud’s is falsifiable—and, at least according to my look at the data, false. (47-48)</em></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.3</span> Looking at Freud 2: Misspellings</h3>
<p>A more powerful, and perhaps less subjective method, is to systematically study a large sample of human behavior to see if, for example, misspellings are biased towards the sexually symbolic.</p>
<p><em>I studied a dataset of more than 40,000 typing errors collected by Microsoft researchers. The dataset included mistakes that people make but then immediately correct. In these tens of thousands of errors, there were plenty of individuals committing errors of a sexual sort. There was the aforementioned “penistrian.” There was also someone who typed “sexurity” instead of “security” and “cocks” instead of “rocks.” But there were also plenty of innocent slips. People wrote of “pindows” and “fegetables,” “aftermoons” and “refriderators.” So was the number of sexual slips unusual? To test this, I first used the Microsoft dataset to model how frequently people mistakenly switch particular letters. I calculated how often they replace a t with an s, a g with an h. I then created a computer program that made mistakes in the way that people do. We might call it Error Bot. Error Bot replaced a t with an s with the same frequency that humans in the Microsoft study did. It replaced a g with an h as often as they did. And so on. I ran the program on the same words people had gotten wrong in the Microsoft study. In other words, the bot tried to spell “pedestrian” and “rocks,” “windows” and “refrigerator.” But it switched an r with a t as often as people do and wrote, for example, “tocks.” It switched an r with a c as often as humans do and wrote “cocks.” So what do we learn from comparing Error Bot with normally careless humans? After making a few million errors, just from misplacing letters in the ways that humans do, Error Bot had made numerous mistakes of a Freudian nature. It misspelled “seashell” as “sexshell,” “lipstick” as “lipsdick,” and “luckiest” as “fuckiest,” along with many other similar mistakes. And—here’s the key point—Error Bot, which of course does not have a subconscious, was just as likely to make errors that could be perceived as sexual as real people were. With the caveat, as we social scientists like to say, that there needs to be more research, this means that sexually oriented errors are no more likely for humans to make than can be expected by chance. In other words, for people to make errors such as “penistrian,” “sexurity,” and “cocks,” it is not necessary to have some connection between mistakes and the forbidden, some theory of the mind where people reveal their secret desires via their errors.</em> (p. 48-49)</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">7.3.4.0.1</span> What PornHub tells us.</h5>
<p><em>a shocking number of people visiting mainstream porn sites are looking for portrayals of incest. Of the top hundred searches by men on PornHub, one of the most popular porn sites, sixteen are looking for incest-themed videos. Fair warning—this is going to get a little graphic: they include “brother and sister,” “step mom fucks son,” “mom and son,” “mom fucks son,” and “real brother and sister.” The plurality of male incestuous searches are for scenes featuring mothers and sons. And women? Nine of the top hundred searches by women on PornHub are for incest-themed videos, and they feature similar imagery—though with the gender of any parent and child who is mentioned usually reversed. Thus the plurality of incestuous searches made by women are for scenes featuring fathers and daughters.</em> (p. 50)</p>
<p>Stephens-Davidowitz goes on to argue that, in addition to this seeming support for the centrality (though not universality) of the Oedipus complex, there is additional support for a more generalized notion of infantile sexuality, that is, that many of the sex fantasies for people of all ages invlve themes or ideas from childhood.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.5</span> Looking at Freud 4: On the hydraulic nature of drives</h3>
<p>One other Freudian idea is supported by more recent PornHub data. Freud argued for a hydraulic model of drives, that is, that drives were bottled up and that sexual and aggressive energy could be released through catharsis. While this appears not to be true for aggression (that is, behaving aggressively does not reduce subsequent aggression), it is, at some level, supported for sex.</p>
<p>At 8:07 on the morning of January 13, cellphones throughout Hawaii received an alert warning that a missile attack was imminent. Thirty-eight minutes later, Hawaiians (and visitors) received a second alert, saying that it was a false alarm.</p>

<p>What is interesting here is not that PornHub traffic dropped during the missile alert, but that it increased afterwards - as if the average Hawaiian (and tourist) more or less made up for lost time afterwards. (Data are pageviews compared to the previous two Saturdays).</p>
