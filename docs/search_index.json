Hochster’s view of data science arguably omits a critical component of the field. Data science is driven not just by statistics and computer science, but also by “domain expertise:” 1.1 Type C data science The iconic Venn diagram model of data science suggests what we can call a “Type C data science.” It begins with “domain expertise” in your concentration in the arts, humanities, social and/or natural sciences, it both informs and can be informed by new methods and tools of data analysis, and it includes such things as communication (including writing and the design and display of quantitative data), collaboration (making use of the tools of team science), and citizenship (serving the public good, overcoming the digital divide, furthering social justice, increasing public health, diminishing human suffering, and making the world a more beautiful place). It’s shaped, too, by an awareness of the creepiness of living increasingly in a measured, observed world. 1.2 The incompleteness of the Venn diagram The Venn diagram model is incomplete. In addition to statistics, computing/hacking, and domain expertise, a number of additional skills contribute to the success of the data scientist. These include collaboration, which is arguably the most distinctive feature of contemporary scholarship in the natural and social sciences as well as in the private sector (Isaacson 2014). Communication is central to data science because results are inconsequential unless they are recognized, understood, and built upon; facets of communication include oral presentations, written texts and, too, clear data visualizations. Reproducibility is related to both communication and collaboration. There has been something of a crisis in recent years in the social and natural sciences as many results initially characterized as “statistically significant” have been found not to replicate. The reasons for this are multiple and presently contentious, but one path towards better science includes the public sharing of methods and data, ideally before experiments are undertaken. Reproducible methods are a key feature of contemporary data science. Pragmatism refers to the relevance of work towards real-world goals. Ideally, these pragmatic concerns take into account ethical concerns as well. 1.3 The expertise dimension Cutting across these eight facets (statistics, computing, domain expertise, collaboration, communication, reproducibility, pragmatism, and ethics), a second dimension can be articulated. No one of us can excel in all eight domains, rather, we might aim towards goals ranging from literacy (can understand) through proficiency (can get by) to fluency (can practice) to leadership (can create new solutions or methods). That is, we can think of a continuum of knowledge, skills, interests, and goals, ranging from that which characterizes the data consumer to the data citizen to the data science contributor. A Type C data science includes this dimension as well. 1.4 Google and the liberal arts Data science is at its core empirical, and all of this rhetoric would be meaningless if not grounded in real world findings. Although it was recently reported that soft skills rather than STEM training were the most important predictors of success among Google employees, it’s difficult to know whether these results would generalize to a less select group. Nonetheless, there is a clear need for individuals with well-rounded training in the liberal arts in data science positions and, conversely, learning data science is arguably a key part of a contemporary liberal arts education. 1.5 Data sci and TMI It has been said (by whom?) that the biggest difference between traditional stats and data science is that the former is typically concerned with making inferences from datasets that are too small, while the latter is concerned with extracting a signal from data that is or are too big. The struggle to extract meaning from a sea of information - of finding needles in haystacks, of finding faint signals in a cacophany of overstimulation - is arguably the question of the age. It is a question we deal with as individuals on a moment-by-moment basis. It is a challenge I face as I wade through the many things that I could include in this class and these notes. The primacy of editing or selection lies at the essence of human perception and the creation of art forms ranging from novels to film. And it is a key challenge for the data scientist faces as well. 1.6 Reviewing the syllabus Note the notion of progress rather than achievement. 1.7 Assignment Please consider, and be prepared to discuss in class: What are your own goals for the class, in terms of the model described above? Read the first chapter of Wickham and Grolemund (2016), and install R and R studio on your own laptop. If you get stuck, reach out to others on Slack; if you don’t get stuck, help your classmates. "]
