The MVRnorm function, in the MASS package, does this. We use this to generate two variables with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, a given correlation, and a given sample size (number of rows). We then fiddle with these variables, setting the means, standard deviations, ranges, and number of significant digits, to make them look like GPA and SAT scores. And we use the randomnames package to make up fake names to go along with the fake scores. Finally, we upload the data to a Google Sheet. knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) library(tidyverse) # library(MASS) the whole library is not loaded because of dplyr::select library(randomNames) library(googlesheets4) set.seed(33458) # for reproducibility correlation &lt;- 0.4 nrows &lt;- 1000 names &lt;- randomNames(nrows, which.names = &quot;first&quot;) %&gt;% bind_cols(randomNames(nrows, which.names = &quot;last&quot;)) %&gt;% rename (FirstName = 1, LastName = 2) hsdata &lt;- MASS::mvrnorm(n = nrows, mu = c(0.0, 0), Sigma = matrix( c(1, correlation, correlation, 1), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% select (gpa = 1, sat = 2) %&gt;% mutate (sat = 500 + (100 * round(sat, 1))) %&gt;% mutate (gpa = 3 + round(gpa, 2)) %&gt;% mutate (gpa = case_when( gpa &lt; 0 ~ 0, gpa &gt; 4.5 ~ 4.5, TRUE ~ gpa)) %&gt;% mutate (sat = case_when( sat &lt; 200 ~ 200, gpa &gt; 800 ~ 800, TRUE ~ sat)) hsdata &lt;- names %&gt;% bind_cols(hsdata) %&gt;% arrange(FirstName) gs4_create(name=&quot;RandomHSGPASAT&quot;, sheets = hsdata) slice(hsdata, 1:3) ## # A tibble: 3 × 4 ## FirstName LastName gpa sat ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Aaliyah Guttadore 0.72 510 ## 2 Aaqil Beltran 2.72 400 ## 3 Aaqil Robbe 0.75 400 6.2 now look at your data in the spreadsheet In this spreadsheet, what are the means for GPA and SAT? What are the standard deviations? what is the difference between ‘sort range’ and ‘sort sheet’ in Google Sheets? What do you think about the randomnames package? Do the names appear “representative” (of what)? If you wanted to generate a more representative sample of names, how might you proceed?
