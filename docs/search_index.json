["preface.html", "preface some features of the text the book is for you", " preface This work-in-progress will ultimately serve as a textbook for introductory undergraduate courses in data sciences. No prior knowledge of computer programming is presumed, though, ideally, students will have had college algebra (or its equivalent) and an introductory course in statistics, methods, or data analysis. Data science is still a new field of study, and there are multiple approaches to teaching it and to its place in the college curriculum. This book is intended to serve courses such as the Introduction to Data Science at the Wilkes Honors College of Florida Atlantic University which, in turn, draws from data science classes at the universities of North Carolina, British Columbia, Duke, Maryland, Wisconsin, Stanford, BYU, Harvard, Pennsylvania, and UC Berkeley At each of these schools, the Introduction to Data Science appears, to my eyes at least, closer to Statistics than to Computer Science. But if our approach is closer to statistics than to programming, it is particularly close to statistics in its most applied and pragmatic form. The choice of statistical methods should follow from the data and problem at hand - or, as Loevinger (1957) once put it, statistics should be the handmaiden of real-world concerns rather than technology. This pragmatic focus is driving the growth of data science in industry, and it is reflected in the way data science is taught at still other schools including Chicago, Georgia Tech, UC Santa Barbara, Princeton, UC Berkeley, at Berlin’s Hertie School of Governance, and in Columbia’s School of Journalism. some features of the text There are a number of different approaches to teaching data science. The present text includes several distinguishing features. R In a recent informal survey of introductory data science courses, I saw a pretty even split between those which begin with Python and those which begin with the statistical programming language R. This difference corresponds, very loosely, to the split noted above: Computer science based approaches to data science are frequently grounded in Python, while statistics-based approaches are generally grounded in R. Our course, like those for most of the syllabi and courses linked above, will be based in R. Reproducible science The course will provide an introduction to some of the methods and tools of reproducible science. We will consider the replication crisis in the natural and social sciences, and then consider three distinct approaches which serve as partial solutions to the crisis. The first of these is training in a notebook-based approach to writing analyses, reports and projects (using R markdown documents). The second is using public repositories (such as the Open Science Framework and GitHub) to provide snapshots of projects over time. Finally, the third is to consider the place of significance testing in the age of Big Data, and to provide training in the use of descriptive, exploratory techniques of data analysis. Good visualizations Part of Type C data science is communication, and this includes not just writing up results, but also designing data displays that incisively convey the key ideas or features in a flood of data. We’ll examine and develop data visualizations such as plots, networks and text clouds. More advanced topics may include maps, interactive displays, and animations. All Some of the data It’s been claimed that in the last dozen years, humans have produced more than 60 times as much information as existed in the entire previous history of humankind. (It sounds like hyperbole, but even if it’s off by an order of magnitude it’s still amazing). There are plenty of data sources for us to examine, and we’ll consider existing datasets from disciplines ranging from literature to economics to public health, with sizes ranging from a few dozen to millions of data points. We will also clean and create new datasets. All Some of the tools In addition to R, we’ll use a range of other tools: We’ll communicate on the Slack platform. We’ll write using markdown editors such as Typora. We’ll certainly use spreadsheets such as Excel or Google Sheets. We may use additional tools for visualizing data such as Gephi and Tableau. In any event, there will be computing throughout the course. You will be expected to bring a laptop every day. (Please let Dr. Lanning know ASAP if you don’t have access to this). the book is for you It’s my intention that this text should serve every college student, regardless of concentration or college major. The skills and insights that you will gain in this course will help you in graduate and professional schools, will help you in your careers, and will help you in your goal of making a better world. And it will help you train the next generation of data scientists as well. references "],
["data-science-for-the-liberal-arts.html", "1 data science for the liberal arts 1.1 type C data science = data science for the liberal arts 1.2 the incompleteness of the data science Venn diagram 1.3 a dimension of depth 1.4 Google and the liberal arts 1.5 data sci and TMI 1.6 discussion: what will you do with data science?", " 1 data science for the liberal arts Hochster, in Hicks and Irizarry (2017), describes two broad types of data scientists: Type A (Analysis) data scientists, whose skills are like those of an applied statistician, and Type B (Building) data scientists, whose skills lie in problem solving or coding, using the skills of the computer scientist. This view arguably omits a critical component of the field, as data science is driven not just by statistics and computer science, but also by “domain expertise:” Fig 1.1 - The iconic data science Venn diagram 1.1 type C data science = data science for the liberal arts The iconic Venn diagram model of data science shown above suggests what we will call “Type C data science.” It begins with “domain expertise” in your concentration in the arts, humanities, social and/or natural sciences, it both informs and can be informed by new methods and tools of data analysis, and it includes such things as communication (including writing and the design and display of quantitative data), collaboration (making use of the tools of team science), and citizenship (serving the public good, overcoming the digital divide, furthering social justice, increasing public health, diminishing human suffering, and making the world a more beautiful place). It’s shaped, too, by an awareness of the fact that the world and workforce are undergoing massive change: This puts the classic liberal arts focus of “learning how to learn” (as opposed to memorization) at center stage. And Type C data science is shaped, not least, by the creepiness of living increasingly in a measured, observed world. Type C data science does not merely integrate ‘domain expertise’ with statistics and computing, it places content squarely at the center. We can appreciate the compelling logic and power of statistics as well as the elegance of well-written code, but for the purposes of this book, these are means to an end. Programming and statistics are tools in the service of social and scientific problems and cultural concerns. Type C data science aims for work which is not merely cool, efficient, or elegant but responsible and meaningful. 1.2 the incompleteness of the data science Venn diagram Data visualizations are starting points which can provide insights, typically highlighting big truths or effects by obscuring other, presumably smaller ones. The Venn diagram model of data science is no exception: As with other graphs, figures, and maps, it allows us to see by showing only part of the picture. What does it omit? That is, beyond statistics, computing/hacking, and domain expertise, what other skills contribute to the success of the data scientist? The complexity of data science is such that individuals typically have expertise in some but not all facets of the area. Consequently, problem solving requires collaboration. Collaboration, even more than statistical and technical sophistication, is arguably the most distinctive feature of contemporary scholarship in the natural and social sciences as well as in the private sector (Isaacson 2014). Communication is central to data science because results are inconsequential unless they are recognized, understood, and built upon; facets of communication include oral presentations, written texts and, too, clear data visualizations. Reproducibility is related to both communication and collaboration. There has been something of a crisis in recent years in the social and natural sciences as many results initially characterized as “statistically significant” have been found not to replicate. The reasons for this are multiple and presently contentious, but one path towards better science includes the public sharing of methods and data, ideally before experiments are undertaken. Reproducible methods are a key feature of contemporary data science. Pragmatism refers to the relevance of work towards real-world goals. These real-world goals should be informed by ethical concerns including a respect for the privacy and autonomy of our fellow humans. 1.3 a dimension of depth Cutting across these various facets (statistics, computing, domain expertise, collaboration, communication, reproducibility, pragmatism, and ethics), a second dimension can be articulated. No one of us can excel in all of these domains, rather, we might aim towards goals ranging from literacy (can understand) through proficiency (can get by) to fluency (can practice) to leadership (can create new solutions or methods). That is, we can think of a continuum of knowledge, skills, interests, and goals, ranging from that which characterizes the data consumer to the data citizen to the data science contributor. A Type C data science includes this dimension of ‘depth’ as well. 1.4 Google and the liberal arts Data science is at its core empirical, and all of this rhetoric would be meaningless if not grounded in real world findings. Although it was reported in late 2017 that soft skills rather than STEM training were the most important predictors of success among Google employees, it’s difficult to know whether these results would generalize to a less select group. Nonetheless, there is a clear need for individuals with well-rounded training in the liberal arts in data science positions and, conversely, learning data science is arguably a key part of a contemporary liberal arts education. 1.5 data sci and TMI One difference between traditional statistics and data science is that the former is typically concerned with making inferences from datasets that are too small, while the latter is concerned with extracting a signal from data that is or are too big (Donoho 2017). The struggle to extract meaning from a sea of information - of finding needles in haystacks, of finding faint signals in a cacophony of overstimulation - is arguably the question of the age. It is a question we deal with as individuals on a moment-by-moment basis. It is a challenge I face as I wade through the many things that I could include in this class and these notes. The primacy of editing or selection lies at the essence of human perception and the creation of art forms ranging from novels to film. And it is a key challenge that the data scientist faces as well. 1.6 discussion: what will you do with data science? Imagine it is ten years from today. You are working in a cool job (yay). How, ideally, would ‘data science’ inform your professional contributions? More proximally (closer to today) - what are your own goals for progress in data science, in terms of the model described above? references "],
["getting-started.html", "2 getting started 2.1 are you already a programmer and statistician? 2.2 setting up your machine: some basic tools 2.3 a modified 15-minute rule 2.4 discussion: who deserves a good grade?", " 2 getting started We begin with a brief self-assessment, asking you to reflect on your own knowledge of data science, including the necessary-but-not-sufficient areas of computer programming and statistics. We then move to a description of some rudimentary tools that we will be using. 2.1 are you already a programmer and statistician? Regarding programming, you may know more than you think you do. Here’s a simple program - a set of instructions - for producing a cup of coffee: add water to the kettle and turn it on if it’s morning, put regular coffee in the French press, otherwise use decaf if the water has boiled, add it to the French press, else keep waiting if the coffee has steeped for four minutes, depress (smash) piston/plunger, else keep waiting pour coffee into cup enjoy As a post-millennial student from a WEIRD culture, or Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich Democracy (Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan 2010), you’ve ‘programmed’ computers, too, if only to enter a password, open an app, and upload a photo on your cell phone. Statistics is of fundamental importance, not just for understanding abstract trends, but for making decisions about everyday life. Consider the case of Susie, a college senior: Exercise 2_1 Susie is applying to two med schools. At School A, 25% of students are accepted, and at School B, 25% are accepted as well. You are Susie. Are you going to get in to at least one of these programs? What is the probability? Does your estimate depend upon any assumptions? Questions such as these are important for us. If the combined probability is low, it likely (another probability concept) will make sense for Susie to spend time, money, and energy to apply to additional programs. If the probability is higher, it may not. But problems like this are hard - our estimates of probability are frequently poorly calibrated, and combining probability estimates is challenging (see, e.g., Tversky and Kahneman (1974), and consider taking a course in Behavioral Economics or Thinking and Decision Making to learn more). You may have worked with data in spreadsheets such as Excel or Google Sheets. Exercise 2_2 Open the Google Sheet at http://bit.ly/dslaX2_1. Save a copy and edit it, entering the following in cell B7: =SUM (B2:B6) What is the result? Now copy cell B7 to C7 What happens? Is this the result you expected? Would another approach be more useful?** Spreadsheets are great tools - the first one, Visi-Calc, was the first “killer app” to usher in the personal computer revolution. But they have limitations as well. Broman and Woo (2017) propose some best practices for using spreadsheets in data science such as, for example, including only data (and not calculations) in spreadsheets, using what we will recognize as a ‘tidy’ format in which data are in a simple rectangle (avoiding the combination of cells and the use of multi-line headers), and saving spreadsheets as simple text files (often as csvs). When we sort data in spreadsheets, we risk chaos, for example, only certain columns may be sorted. When we manipulate data in spreadsheets, we typically will not have a record of what was (and wasn’t) changed, this compromises the reproducibility of our work. The bottom line is that spreadsheets should generally be used to store data rather than to analyze it. 2.2 setting up your machine: some basic tools Collaboration and communication are integral to data science. In the world beyond universities, the most important messaging and collaboration platform is Slack. Slack is a commercial app, but we will use the free tier. We’ll use Slack for group work, class announcements, and help-seeking and help-providing. Slack includes a simple markdown editor (for ‘posts’). You can find an introduction to markdown syntax in Chapter 3 of Freeman and Ross (2017). I use Typora (currently free for both Windows and Mac), but there are many alternatives. Install this or another Markdown editor on your laptop and play with it. Install R then R studio on your own Windows or Mac laptop. We’ll use R studio as a front end (an ‘integrated development environment’, or IDE) for R, and will write most of our code in R markdown which is, not surprisingly, a ‘flavor’ of markdown. We’ll go into R in increasing depth beginning in the next chapter; if you want to get a head start, consider Carmichael (2017) Getting started and the first chapter of Wickham and Grolemund (2016). (Those documents, like this one, are all written in R markdown). Eager to start coding in R? Go to Chapter 4 (draw the rest of the owl), and begin the exercises in swirl (swirlstats). Google Docs is free and is convenient for collaborative work. One other important feature of Google Docs is that it provides a framework for version control, a critical skill in information management. You can learn more about how to see and revert to prior versions of a project in Google Docs here. Version control can help you avoid the chaos and confusion of having a computer (or several computers) full of files that look like Cham’s (2012) comic: Fig 2.1: Never call anything ‘final.doc’. Version control is an important concept in data science. Collaboratively built programs and platforms, including most of the add-ons (libraries, packages) which make R so powerful, are open-source projects built by many individuals over time. For projects such as these, both the current build and its associated history are typically maintained on GitHub, a website for hosting code. When we contribute to these projects, we will first mirror the web-based GitHub site using a program on our own Macs or Windows PCs called Git, then upload our proposed changes. Keeping remote and local branches of files in sync can be challenging, however, and you will not be expected to use this technology in this class. But if you are curious, or want to learn more, an introduction to using Git and R together may be found here. 2.3 a modified 15-minute rule You will run into problems, if not here, then elsewhere. An important determinant of your success will be the balance you maintain between persistence and help-seeking. The 15-minute rule is one guideline for this balance: It has been cleverly summarized as “You must try, and then you must ask.” That is, if you get stuck, keep trying for 15 minutes, then reach out to others. I think that this rule is basically sound, particularly if it is applied with cognitive flexibility, social sensitivity, and reciprocity. So when you get stuck, make a note of the problem, then move to another part of your project (that’s the cognitive flexibility part): This allows your problem to percolate and still make progress. When you ask others for help, ask in a way that shows an awareness of the demands on their time (social sensitivity): Part of this means that you should explain your problem in as detailed a fashion as possible - in technical terms, a “reprex” or reproducible example. Finally, you should be willing to provide as well as give help (reciprocity). 2.4 discussion: who deserves a good grade? In an introductory class in data science, students invariably come to class with different backgrounds. Should this be taken into account in assigning grades? That is, would it be possible (and desirable) to assign grades in a class based not just on what students know at the end of the term, but also on how much they have learned? A formal, statistical approach to this could use regression analysis. That is, one could predict final exam scores from pretest scores, and use the residuals - the extent to which students did better or worse than expected - as a contributor to final exam grades. Interestingly, there would be an unusual incentive for students on this ‘pretest’ to do, seemingly perversely, as poorly as possible. How could this be addressed? Another problem with this approach is that there may be ‘ceiling effects’ - students who are the strongest coming in to the class can’t improve as much as those who have more room to grow. Again, how might this be addressed? Should it? references "],
["r-stands-for.html", "3 R stands for … 3.1 a few characteristics of R 3.2 finding help 3.3 Wickham and R for Data Science", " 3 R stands for … Historically, R grew out of S which could stand for Statistics. But what does R stand for? R is a system for Reproducible analysis, and reproducibility is essential. R markdown documents, like Jupyter notebooks in the Python world, facilitate reproducible work, as they include comments or explanations, code, links to data, and results. R is for Research. Research is not just an end-product, not just a published paper or book: … these documents are not the research [rather] these documents are the “advertising”. The research is the “full software environment, code, and data that produced the results” [Buckheit and Donoho, 1995, Donoho, 2010, 385]. When we separate the research from its advertisement we are making it difficult for others to verify the findings by reproducing them. (Gandrud 2016) R is a system for Representing data in cool, insight-facilitating ways, a tool for creating (reproducible) data visualizations which can provide insights and communicate results. R is Really popular, and this matters, because learning R will make you a more attractive candidate for many graduate programs as well as jobs in the private sector. Because R is popular, there are many Resources, including, for example - Online resources include the simple (and less simple) lessons of SwirlR, which offers the possibility of “learning R in R,” as well as DataCamp, the Data Science Certificate Program at Johns Hopkins, and other MOOCs. Books include Peng (2015) - which includes not only videos of his lectures in the program at Hopkins, but also a brief list of still more resources - and Wickham and Grolemund (2016). You’ll also learn (more directly) from people, including your classmates, as well as the broader community of people around the world. There are hundreds if not thousands of people, young and old, who are on the road with you. I am as well, just a step or two (hopefully) ahead. R might stand for Relatively high level. Programming languages can be described along a continuum from high to low level, the former (like R) are more accessible to humans, the latter (like assembly language) more accessible to machines. Python, Java, and C++ are all more towards the middle of this continuum. R does not stand for ‘[arggh](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ARGH),’ although you may proclaim this in frustration (‘arggh, why can’t I get this to work?) or, perhaps, in satisfaction (’arggh, matey, that be a clever way of doing this’). But R does stand for Rewarding. A language is a way of thinking about the world, and this is true for computer languages as well. You’ll be challenged by its complexity, its idiosyncracy, its alien logic. But you will succeed, and you will find that you can do things that you did not believe possible. 3.1 a few characteristics of R R includes the base together with packages. These packages (libraries) are customized add-ons which simplify certain tasks, such as text analysis. There are, at this writing, 15,373 available packages on the CRAN package repository - and though there is not yet an R package for ordering pizza (Peng 2015), there are many for most data tasks, including, for example, over 50 different packages for text analysis. So how do you choose, and where do you begin? We will start with the curated list of packages which jointly comprise the tidyverse (Wickham and Grolemund 2016), which is effectively a dialect of R. R is an object-oriented language - one conceptually organized around objects and data rather than actions and logic. In R, at the atomic level, objects include characters, real numbers, integers, complex numbers, and logical. These atoms are combined into vectors, which generally include objects of the same type (one kind of object, “lists,” is an exception to this; Peng 2015). Vectors can be further combined into data frames, which are two-dimensional tables or arrays. A tibble is a particular type of data frame which is used in the tidyverse. It is, in some ways, handier to work with than other data frames. We’ll be working extensively with data frames in general, and tibbles in particular, as we move forward. Objects have attributes. Attributes of R include such things as name, dimensions (for vectors and arrays), class (that’s the type of object described in the previous paragraph), length, etc. Real world data sets are messy, and frequently have missing values. In R, missing values may be characterized by NA (not available) or NaN (not a number, implying an undefined or impossible value). RStudio, the environment we will use to write, test, and run R code, is a commercial enterprise whose business model, judged from afar, is an important one in the world of technology. Most of what RStudio offers is free (97% according to Garrett Grolemund in the video below). The commercial product they offer makes sense for a relative few, but it is sufficiently lucrative to fund the enterprise. The free product helps to drive the popularity of Rstudio; this widespread use, in turn, makes it increasingly essential for businesses to use. This mixed free/premium, or ‘freemium,’ model characterizes Slack as well, but while the ratio of free to paid users of Slack is on the order of 3:1, for R it is, I am guessing, an order of magnitude higher than this. 3.2 finding help One does not simply ‘learn R.’ Unlike, say, learning to ride a bicycle, fry an egg, or drive a car with a manual transmission, learning R is not a discrete accomplishment that one can be said to have mastered and from which one then moves on. Rather, R is an evolving, open system of applications and tools which is so vast that there is always more that one can achieve, new lessons that one can learn. And, the complexity of R syntax is such that, for almost all of us, we will need help for coding on any non-trivial task. For us, the key ideas in “looking for help” will include not just the tools on the RStudio IDE, but also (a) using Google searches wisely, and (b) reaching out to your classmates on Slack. Here, as in the real world, there is an etiquette for help-seeking which is based on consideration. Your search for help should begin by making sure that others will encounter the same result, then by stripping the problem down to its essence. Once you have reduced the problem to this minimal, reproducible essence, you will often be able to spot the problem yourself - and, if not, you will make it easier for others to help you. There is an R package (reprex) which will likely facilitate this, but I haven’t tried it yet. Here is a good introduction. Finally, to get a sense of some of the ways you can get help in RStudio (and to see how a master uses the R Studio interface), consider this video: Video 3.1: Garrett Grolemund of RStudio 3.3 Wickham and R for Data Science The first chapter of the Wickham text (Wickham and Grolemund 2016) provides a framework for his approach and a brief introduction to the tidyverse which will be the dialect of R we will study in the weeks ahead.

Be prepared to discuss your progress next class (you will be asked which source(s) you used, what you struggled with, and whether you would recommend it to your classmates. (Note that all of these are free, though you may choose to make a donation to the author if you use the Peng text). Hint: If you find the material too challenging - if you feel like you are drawing the rest of the owl - take a break away from your machine and other screens, clear your head, then try a different approach. 4.1 Carmichael Iain Carmichael prepared the following for his Intro to Data Science course at UNC-Chapel Hill. I think it is a great place to start: https://idc9.github.io/stor390/notes/getting_started/getting_started.html 4.2 DataCamp Many folks swear by (and others, I presume, at) DataCamp, which kind of gamifies learning software. As a student in this class, you have access to all of their stuff… free. You can even do lessons on your phone. 4.3 Swirl (Swirlstats) I, like thousands of others, learned R in the process of completing the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization offered through Coursera. The sequence can be challenging, but their introduction to R used an accessible, interactive R package called Swirl. You can read about swirl (“learn R in R”) at https://swirlstats.com/. Using Swirl. After loading R (and opening R studio), you will get to the Swirl lessons with the following steps: Install the Swirl package on your computer (you only need to do this once). Type the following into your console window in R studio (typically left hand side of your screen or lower left) install.packages(“swirl”) Then load the package into your workspace (you’ll need to do this at the beginning of every session you use Swirl) library (swirl) Then run it! swirl () Swirl will ask a few questions then give you the option of choosing one of several courses. You’ll choose the R Programming option, which leads to 15 separate lessons. At the end of each lesson, you’ll be asked Would you like to receive credit for completing this course on Coursera.org? Answer no… then do another lesson. 4.4 Peng text and videos Finally, consider the text and videos from the Coursera R class. Most of the material from that class can be found in Peng (2015). A slightly updated version of the text can be found at https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/, and the videos in the series may be found by clicking on the following: . Video 4.2: Roger Peng introducing R 4.5 Something else The “something else” category includes Datacarpentry.org, which is aimed at fostering data literacy and provides free lessons for learning and applying R in areas such as Ecology, Genomics and Geospatial data analysis. Of particular interest are the social science lessons, as well as a workshop in data science based on the \"Studying African Farmer-led Irrigation (SAFI)\" dataset. 4.6 An exercise Review Carmichael’s Getting started with R. Open R studio, and create a new R script called myMovies.R. Using his code as a reference, do each of the following Work in your source window. On the first line, enter the command to install the tidyverse, using the chunk below - but omit the octothorpe. (If you’ve already installed the tidyverse, keep the #). # install.packages (&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Hit ctrl+enter to run this line. Now comment it out if you haven’t already done so (why)? Load the tidyverse into your workspace. Load the movies/IMDB dataset. Start exploring the data and the RStudio interface: Apply the str (structure), head, and summary commands. When are each of these useful? Double-click the movies dataset in your environment tab in R studio. Click on a few columns to sort the data. In the data, what does ‘spilled’ mean? How did you find out? How many rows and columns are in the data? We can think about the movies dataset as a matrix with rows and columns, and subset it using the following. # data.frame[rownumber,colnumber] # data.frame[&quot;rowname&quot;, &quot;colname&quot;] # data.frame[rowname, c(&quot;colname, colname&quot;)] movies[&quot;title&quot;] movies[title] movies[title,] Ask an interesting question about the data, and enter it as a comment in your code, e.g., # how long was the movie 42-up? Try to find the answer, ideally using reproducible code, and be prepared to share it with the class. Save your work :) 4.6.1 An initial solution Here’s a sample solution supplied by one group of students. I’ve added some comments to make it useful to my present and future self. # notes from class 1/22/20 # exercise in Data Science for Liberal Arts # contributed by _________ _______ # ---------- # run this line just once to put package on machine # install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) library(tidyverse) # this loads a movie dataset from the web load(url(&#39;https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/movies.Rdata&#39;)) # some ways to look at the dataset View(movies) str(movies) head(movies) summary(movies) head(movies$genre) head(movies$genre,100) # an initial plot ggplot(data = movies) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = imdb_rating, y = critics_score)) # what does &quot;spilled&quot; mean? summary(movies$audience_rating) ggplot(data = movies) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = audience_score, y = audience_rating)) # this displays the list of movies movies[&quot;title&quot;] # this writes the list of movies to a new vector b &lt;- movies[&quot;title&quot;] # which genre has the highest audience score? ggplot(data = movies) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = genre, y = audience_score, color=mpaa_rating)) ggplot(data = movies) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = genre, y = audience_score, color=audience_score)) # these commands fail - why? # view(genre,audience_score) # summary(genre,audience_score) # Summary(&quot;genre&quot;) # # this works! c &lt;- movies[&quot;genre&quot;] # but not this # d &lt;- movies(&quot;audience_score&quot;) d &lt;- movies[&quot;audience_score&quot;] # # subsetting a file # # base syntax to create a new file # with the 3rd,4th, and 7th columns in movies movies2 &lt;- movies[,c(3,4,7)] # tidyverse syntax to # create a new file with just the first variable in movies2 movies3 &lt;- movies2 %&gt;% select(1) 4.7 An introduction to R markdown The above script worked fine, but it is not a good record of my examination of the movie database. It tells only part of the story (it doesn’t include the results), and it doesn’t tell it particularly clearly (the comments that explain the logic and syntax of my work are mixed in with the code that executes it). In literate programming, these aspects of work are clearly articulated and retained. R markdown documents are tools for elegantly integrating comments, code, and results - they document our work. We’ll return to this in some detail later; for now, to create an R markdown (Rmd) document in R studio, begin with (File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown). A window will open up with a file that begins with some YAML (Yet Another Markdown Language). You can edit this as needed: --- title: &quot;My first R Markdown Document&quot; author: &quot;Frankie McFrank Frank&quot; date: &quot;1/27/2020&quot; output: html_document --- Click on the clever “knit” icon in the bar just above the source window to create a sample document. You’ll need to save the file with a new name, then R will finally create an HTML (Hyper Text Markdown Language - see the pattern?) page. Compare the R Markdown document (your code) with the result (the HTML). Now, try to knit the document into different output formats (click on the down arrow next to knit, and see if you can knit to PDF and Word). It may take a while the first time you do this, as you may need to load some additional formatting tools or packages (e.g., TinyTex) to successfully render these files. After you have admired the results, continue editing your .Rmd document. You will replace the chunks (everything but the YAML at the top of the document) with the code from the Carmichael project. You can insert a chunk of code using the “insert” then “R” commands at the top of your source window. 4.7.1 Step-by-step When I am writing an R markdown document in R studio, I’ll generally work on one chunk at a time, testing each in turn (generally by clicking the run triangle at the top of the chunk). Once I am done, I knit the document as a whole as a complete record of my work. My first chunk loads the libraries and data. When I write this, I’ll modify the top of the chunk to say {r message=FALSE} rather than just {r} so that I don’t get too much chatter about this step: library(tidyverse) load(url(&#39;https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/movies.Rdata&#39;)) So from here on, the shaded blocks include code and results. My next verbatim chunk looks like this when I write it and when I test it: ` ``{r whatever} str(movies) head(movies) summary(movies) head(movies$genre) # head(movies$genre,100) why is this commented out? ` `` When I “knit” it, the results are folded in as follows: str(movies) ## Classes &#39;tbl_df&#39;, &#39;tbl&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 651 obs. of 32 variables: ## $ title : chr &quot;Filly Brown&quot; &quot;The Dish&quot; &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; ... ## $ title_type : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Documentary&quot;,..: 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 ... ## $ genre : Factor w/ 11 levels &quot;Action &amp; Adventure&quot;,..: 6 6 4 6 7 5 6 6 5 6 ... ## $ runtime : num 80 101 84 139 90 78 142 93 88 119 ... ## $ mpaa_rating : Factor w/ 6 levels &quot;G&quot;,&quot;NC-17&quot;,&quot;PG&quot;,..: 5 4 5 3 5 6 4 5 6 6 ... ## $ studio : Factor w/ 211 levels &quot;20th Century Fox&quot;,..: 91 202 167 34 13 163 147 118 88 84 ... ## $ thtr_rel_year : num 2013 2001 1996 1993 2004 ... ## $ thtr_rel_month : num 4 3 8 10 9 1 1 11 9 3 ... ## $ thtr_rel_day : num 19 14 21 1 10 15 1 8 7 2 ... ## $ dvd_rel_year : num 2013 2001 2001 2001 2005 ... ## $ dvd_rel_month : num 7 8 8 11 4 4 2 3 1 8 ... ## $ dvd_rel_day : num 30 28 21 6 19 20 18 2 21 14 ... ## $ imdb_rating : num 5.5 7.3 7.6 7.2 5.1 7.8 7.2 5.5 7.5 6.6 ... ## $ imdb_num_votes : int 899 12285 22381 35096 2386 333 5016 2272 880 12496 ... ## $ critics_rating : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Certified Fresh&quot;,..: 3 1 1 1 3 2 3 3 2 1 ... ## $ critics_score : num 45 96 91 80 33 91 57 17 90 83 ... ## $ audience_rating : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Spilled&quot;,&quot;Upright&quot;: 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ... ## $ audience_score : num 73 81 91 76 27 86 76 47 89 66 ... ## $ best_pic_nom : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ best_pic_win : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ best_actor_win : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 ... ## $ best_actress_win: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ best_dir_win : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ top200_box : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ director : chr &quot;Michael D.

We are concerned not just with the design of graphs, but with our role in society as leaders, as arbiters of facts, as educators. We want to foster data literacy. How do people understand graphs? How can you use graphs to tell people the truth in a way that they understand? How can you convey uncertainty in a graph? When you see a graph, what do you notice, what do you wonder, and what is the story? Is “story telling” what visualizations should be about? A graph might begin with perception and understanding (the consumer), with knowledge and design values (the producer), but it also reflects the truth of the data. How much is each? 5.2 Some early graphs Visual displays of information reach back to prehistoric times; modern graphs date back, arguably, to Playfair’s 1786 Political Atlas - in which “… spatial dimensions were used to represent nonspatial, quantitative, idiographic, empirical data. Although it now seems natural to represent, for example, rising and falling imports over time as a rising and falling line, it does not seem to have been done before that time and was quite an accomplishment. Notably, in addition to the statistical line chart, Playfair at one fell swoop single-handedly invented most of the remaining forms of the statistical graphic repertoire used today-the bar chart and histogram, the surface chart, and the circle diagram or”pie chart.\" (Wainer and Thissen 1981) source The most celebrated early graph is that of Minard: source The visualization depicts the size, latitude, and longitude of Napoleon’s army as they moved towards (tan line) then away (black line) from Moscow; temperature during the retreat is plotted as well. Further, vertical lines linking the temperature display to the number of troops indicate the often perilous river crossings which further decimated Napoleon’s troops). Cheng (2014) decomposes the graph and provides some simpler visualizations; she also provides the following background: \"Czar Alexander of Russia sees that Napoleon was becoming too powerful, so he refuses to participate in this embargo [against the UK]. Angry at Czar Alexander’s decision, Napoleon gathers a massive army of over 400,000 to attack Russia in June of 1812. While Russia’s troops are not as numerous as France’s, Russia has a plan. Russian troops keep retreating as Napoleon’s troops move forward, burning everything they pass, ensuring that the French forces could not take anything from their environment. Eventually the French army follows the Russian army all the way to Moscow during October, suffering major losses from lack of food. By the time Napoleon gets to Moscow, he knows he has to retreat. As winter settles into Europe and the temperature drops, Napoleon’s troops suffer even more losses, returning to France from lack of food, disease, and weather conditions.\" Of course, the casualties and retreat of Napoleon’s army are immortalized not just in this graph, but also in Russian literature (Tolstoy’s War and Peace) and music (Tchaikovsky’s 1812 overture, in which five cannon shots mark the battle of Borodino and eleven more mark the arrival of Napoleon in the now-razed city of Moscow). 5.3 Tukey and EDA For Donoho (2017), the publication of John Tukey’s “Future of Data Analysis” (Tukey 1962) arguably marks the beginning of data science. As the first data scientist, Tukey embraced a descriptive and exploratory approach to data analysis, particularly in his publication of Exploratory Data Analysis (Tukey 1977). In EDA, Tukey presented an idiosyncratic, coherent approach to looking at data, beginning with tallying. The distributions of small counts of single variables, for Tukey, could best be presented in stem and leaf displays. Comparisons between groups can be presented in box plots. To examine relationships between variables and the adequacy of simple models, he argues for thoughtfully transforming data to uncover linear trends, then to examine residuals to find where these trends do not hold. 5.4 Approaches to graphs A graph might begin with perception and understanding (the consumer), with knowledge and design values (the producer), but it also reflects the truth of the data. How much is each? In thinking about how to design graphs, we can begin with abstract theory, with principles of design informed by our understanding of perception, or with empirical analyses of understanding and memory. 5.5 Tufte: First principles Tufte (2001) describes Graphical Excellence. Graphs should, among other things, “Induce the viewer to think about the substance, rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic productions, or something else.” Graphs should “Present many numbers in a small space, make large data sets coherent, and encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data.” Graphs should “serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation, or decoration [and] be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data set.” Tufte concludes with the following Principles of Graphical Excellence, which I quote verbatim: Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data—a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design. Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency. Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space. Graphical excellence is nearly always multivariate. And graphical excellence requires telling the truth. 5.6 The politics of data visualization In a cold morning in January, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger lifted off from Cape Canaveral. Because of the cold weather, engineers at Morton Thiokol, who designed the rocket boosters, considered the possibility that the O-rings which sealed joints on the rockets would be too hard and brittle to prevent the release of potentially explosive fuel. They examined the relation between temperature and o-ring damage on prior flights, using the following visualization: Figure 5.3: What Motron Thiokol engineers saw prior to deciding to launch the Challenger Space Shuttle in January, 1986 What, if anything, can we see here? The graphic was chaotic and poorly designed; if the engineers had wanted to systematically explore the relation between o-ring damage and temperature they could have removed the rockets and arranged them on a single axis by liftoff-temperature rather on several rows by liftoff-date. Here’s what they would have seen: Figure 5.4: What the engineers could have seen, perhaps, with a better graph. The forecast for the morning of the launch was far colder than that for prior launches, and within the set of prior launches a clear relationship between temperature and o-ring damage is evident. But the Challenger did launch, exploding shortly after takeoff, killing the seven astronauts on board. With a clearer display of the data, the Challenger launch would likely have been postponed (Tufte 2001 ). 5.6.1 Poor design leads to an uninformed or misinformed world In the flood of information that surrounds us, our peripheral and sometimes our focal attention will be drawn to pictorial summaries of consequential events and effects. But while data visualizations and data journalism has become more responsible, poorly designed graphs - what Tufte has described as “chartjunk” - are still common. Consider the following graph, which recently appeared in a number of newspapers or feeds in the United States (including the Palm Beach Post, on January 12, 2019). Figure 5.5: Which smartphone manufacturers are doing well? Exercise 5_1 Examine the graph shown above. Look at it for just a moment, as if you might while reading something else on the screen, or as your ten-year old little sister might. What does the graph tell you? Look at it more closely. What does it actually say? How could you improve it to make the content of the graph more informative about its title? Why was the graph designed in this way? Does this matter? Poorly designed graphs don’t just confuse rocket scientists. They reach us, mislead us, and make fools of all of us as well. With better graphs, we become a better informed, better educated citizenry. 5.6.2 Poor design can be a tool to deceive Figure 5.6: Trump as “the first datavis President” (Meeks, 2019). The apps on our smartphones and electronic devices are meticulously designed to maintain our attention. They are largely successful, but, for many of us, made it more difficult to read in depth (Wu, The Attention Merchants). With information all around us demanding our attention, visual representations of data have become particularly important. The data visualization is, increasingly, not just a supplement to the story, but the story itself. When this premise is coupled with the idea that the truth is malleable, the product of what our leaders say rather than empirical statements of fact, we approach a dangerous situation, one in which real threats are misrepresented and lives are again endangered. Presenting information in self-promoting ways includes so-called “Sharpie-gate,” where President Trump simply altered a hurricane prediction map in defense of a misstatement. It also includes more subtle misrepresentations: Does stand-your-ground really make us safer? Figure 5.7: Stand your ground makes us all not-safer. 5.7 The psychology of data visualization Speaking of America, consider the following: Figure 5.8: Chernoff’s too-clever faces In this figure, from Wainer and Thissen (1981), (Chernoff’s) faces are used to represent multivariate data. The display is loosely based on the (psychological) premise that, from infancy, we are inordinately sensitive to facial features. Consequently, the most powerful, effective, or informative data displays should manipulate facial features. Does this graph succeed? Why or why not? Would an updated model, based on richer, more complex, and more realistic simulations of facial expressions (Thies et al. 2015) be more successful? More contemporary and rigorously psychologically-informed studies of data visualizations include the work 5.7.1 The power of animation Animated data displays bring the dimension of time into data visualization. Here are two brief (&lt; 5 minutes) animated data displays, each powerful in its own way, and each of which gives the viewer an appreciation of an important social phenomenon. The first is from the late Hans Rosling, and summarizes a chunk of the Gapminder data. There is a Gapminder package in R if you would like to explore the data further, and perhaps become the next Rosling: img.youtube.com/vi/jbkSRLYSojo/0.jpg Video 5.9: Rosling and social progress The second is from Kim Rees and her ex-colleagues at Periscopic (Rees is now at CapitalOne). For me, it’s an important graphic because it tries to overcome what has been called “psychic numbing” - we are sensitive to the individual case, but lose our perspective when faced with large-scale tragedies, so that effectively the more lives lost… the less we care (Slovic et al. 2013). Video 5.10: Rees and stolen years 5.7.2 Telling the truth when the truth is unclear We live in an uncertain world, and a major challenge in data visualization is how to convey this uncertainty in a way that people understand readily. Examples of this are familiar. Here in Florida, projected hurricane paths are frequently represented by a “cone of uncertainty” surrounding a single track. An alternative approach is to use a display which shows a distribution of possible tracks. Figure 5.11: Two approaches to displaying hurricane paths 5.7.3 Visualizing uncertainty To further illustrate the idea of uncertainty, data visualizations may be animated. To display hurricane outcomes, for example, individual lines in a spaghetti plot might fade in and out (see Cox and Lindell 2013). Another use of animation is suggested by (Hullman, Resnick, and Adar 2015) who use hypothetical outcome plots rather than simple error bars to illustrate sampling distributions. Empirically, subjects have a better understanding of the meaning of statistical effects when these are represented by dynamic displays. During the 2016 US Presidential Election, the NY Times graphics presented the range of likely possibilities (here, between the 25th and 75th percentiles) as a dynamically changing “jittery gauge” . Following the election, there was some criticism of these gauges, as readers claimed that they tended to make them anxious. However, it appears that at least some of the anxiety was attributable not to the gauges themselves, but to the electoral outcome itself. The gauges were back in 2018, and will likely be used again in the future. Finally, animation may be used not just to display uncertainty or a possible range, but also data displays which both carry a great deal of information and unfold over time, such as the language of personality development in my own work. 5.8 further reading and resources If you’d like to learn more, Tufte (2001) and his other books are beautiful and thought provoking. Cleveland and McGill (1985) examines graphs from a more rigorous psychological and empirical viewpoint. The Data Stories podcasts are often excellent, despite the challenge of an auditory medium for visual display (especially the episode on Hans Rosling). And Healy (2017) provides a comprehensive introduction that, in essence, provides the basis for a semester-long course based in the ggplot2 package in R that we will be working with in the next chapter (Wickham and Grolemund 2016). Finally, there is a massively open online course (MOOC) taught by Alberto Cairo of the University of Miami at https://journalismcourses.org/data-viz-course-material.html references "],
["visualization-in-r-with-ggplot.html", "6 visualization in R with ggplot 6.1 a picture &gt; (words, numbers)? 6.2 Read Hadley ggplots 6.3 exploring more data 6.4 Advanced: Tracking the Novel Coronavirus", " 6 visualization in R with ggplot In the last chapter, we introduced data visualization, citing “vision-aries” including Edward Tufte and Hans Rosling, inspired works such as Minard’s Carte Figurative and Periscopic’s stolen years, as well as a few cautionary tales of misleading and confusing graphs. Here, in playing with and learning the R package ggplot, we begin to move from consumers to creators of data visualizations. As the first visualization in Wickham and Grolemund (2016) reminds us, data visualization is at the core of exploratory data analysis: Fig 6.1: Data visualization is at the core of data analysis (Wickham and Grolemund (2016)) In the world of data science, statistical programming is about discovering and communicating truths within your data. This exploratory data analysis is the corner of science, particularly at a time in which confirmatory studies are increasingly found to be unreproducible. Most of your reading will be from Chapter 3 of Wickham and Grolemund (2016), this is intended only as a supplement. 6.1 a picture &gt; (words, numbers)? The chapter begins with a quote from John Tukey about the importance of graphs. Yet there is a tendency among some statisticians and scientists to discount graphs, to consider graphic representations of data as less valuable than statistical ones. It is true that, because there are many ways to graph data, and because scientists and data journalists are humans with pre-existing beliefs and values, a graphical displays should not be assumed to simply depict a singular reality. But the same can be said about statistical analyses (see Chapter 8). To consider the value of statistical versus graphical displays, consider ‘Anscombe’s quartet’ (screenshot below, live at http://bit.ly/anscombe2019): Table 6.1: An adaptation of Anscombe’s “quartet” (Anscombe 1973b) Exercise 6_1 Consider the spreadsheet chunk presented above, which I am characterizing as data collected on a sample of ten primary school children at recess on four consecutive days. Working with your classmates, compute the mean, standard deviation, and correlation between the two measures for one day. Share your results with the class. The four pairs of variables in Anscombe (1973b) appear statistically “the same,” yet the data suggest something else. Later, we’ll try to plot these. Perhaps graphs can reveal truths that statistics can hide. 6.2 Read Hadley ggplots In class, we will review and recreate the plots in section 3.2 of Wickham and Grolemund (2016) and exercises through 3.4. Savor this section, reading slowly, and playing around with the RStudio interface. For example, read about the mpg data in the ‘help’ panel, pull up the mpg data in a view window, and sort through it by clicking on various columns. Fig. 6.2: A screenshot from RStudio, showing the mpg dataset 6.3 exploring more data Explore the Gapminder data https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/README.html Choose one of the datasets in R, pull out a few variables, and explore these. Try to make a cool graph - one that informs the viewer, and, to paraphrase Tukey, helps us see what we don’t expect. Try several different displays. Which fail? Which succeed? Be prepared to share your efforts. Don’t be afraid to screw up. 6.4 Advanced: Tracking the Novel Coronavirus Here, I want to consider a timely (but challenging) dataset. The Novel Coronavirus is an emerging health crisis, particularly in Wuhan (a Chinese city larger than New York City) and the surrounding province of Hubei. It is not yet a threat in the United States - there have, at this writing (02/11/20) been zero cases in Florida. Still, tracking the spread of the virus - the unfolding number of people infected and recovered, as well as the number of deaths - is a fascinating exercise. This is an educational script for students learning R with the Tidyverse. It reads data provided by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU/CSSE). It was modified February 3 because of new GoogleSheet link and altered variable names, on Feb 5 because of a new URL for the data and additional changes in the variable name for date, and Feb 7 to (a) remove need for OAuth and (b) separate Wuhan from other China. On Feb 9, additional data cleaning was performed and interactive plots were added. On February 11, the code was rewritten to read files from a Github repo rather than Google Sheets. This does not use an API or require authorization from Github. library(tidyverse) library(magrittr) library(lubridate) library(plotly) library(htmlwidgets) library(httr) library(purrr) # get list of files filelist &lt;- GET(&quot;https://api.github.com/repos/CSSEGISandData/2019-nCoV/git/trees/master?recursive=1&quot;) %&gt;% content() %&gt;% # there is probably a more efficient way to reduce this # list to a set of filenames flatten() %&gt;% map (&quot;path&quot;) %&gt;% flatten() %&gt;% tibble() %&gt;% rename(filename = 1) %&gt;% filter(str_detect(filename,&quot;.csv&quot;) &amp; str_detect(filename,&quot;daily&quot;)) nsheets &lt;- nrow(filelist) rawGitFiles &lt;- &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/2019-nCoV/master/&quot; 6.4.1 Reading the data The Novel Coronavirus data consists of a series of csv files in a Github repository.

It’s generally time consuming, as was the case here. The following letters refer to sections of the code below. a - fix a few missing values outside of China for province and country b - the earliest cases, all in China, did not include country c - because province/state is included inconsistently, an unambiguous place variable is created d - reportdate is standardized (above) and renamed e - in some cases, multiple reports are issued for each day. only the last of these is used for each place. f - for dates where no data was supplied, the most recent (previous) data are used g - values of NA for Deaths, Confirmed, and Recovered cases are replaced by zero. h - Prior to Feb 1, reporting for US included only state, since then, city and state. This drops the (duplicated) province/state-only values beginning Feb 1. coronaData %&lt;&gt;% # a mutate (`Province/State` = case_when( (is.na(`Province/State`) &amp; (`Country/Region` == &quot;Australia&quot;)) ~ &quot;New South Wales&quot;, (is.na(`Province/State`) &amp; (`Country/Region` == &quot;Germany&quot;)) ~ &quot;Bavaria&quot;, TRUE ~ `Province/State`)) %&gt;% mutate (`Country/Region` = case_when( `Province/State` == &quot;Hong Kong&quot; ~ &quot;Hong Kong&quot;, `Province/State` == &quot;Taiwan&quot; ~ &quot;Taiwan&quot;, `Province/State` == &quot;Washington&quot; ~ &quot;US&quot;, # b is.na (`Country/Region`) ~ &quot;Mainland China&quot;, TRUE ~ `Country/Region`)) %&gt;% # c mutate(place = ifelse(is.na(`Province/State`), `Country/Region`, paste0(`Province/State`,&quot;, &quot;, `Country/Region`))) %&gt;% mutate(reportDate = date(`Last Update`)) %&gt;% group_by(place,reportDate) %&gt;% # e slice(which.max(`Last Update`)) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% # fill in missing dates for each place for time series # f group_by(place) %&gt;% complete(reportDate = seq.Date(min(reportDate), today(), by=&quot;day&quot;)) %&gt;% fill(c(Confirmed,Deaths,Recovered, `Country/Region`,`Province/State`)) %&gt;% # g ungroup() %&gt;% mutate_if(is.numeric, ~replace_na(., 0)) %&gt;% # h mutate(dropcase = ((!str_detect(`Province/State`,&quot;,&quot;)) &amp; (reportDate &gt; &quot;2020-01-31&quot;) &amp; (`Country/Region` == &quot;Canada&quot; | `Country/Region` == &quot;US&quot;))) %&gt;% # dplyr called explicitly here because plotly has taken over &#39;filter&#39; dplyr::filter (!dropcase) %&gt;% select(-c(`Last Update`,`Province/State`,`Country/Region`,dropcase)) 6.4.3 Simplifying the data: China and the rest of the world This separates data into three locations, breaking down China into Hubei (Wuhan) and other, then summarizes results: coronaDataSimple &lt;- coronaData %&gt;% mutate(country = case_when( str_detect(place,&quot;China&quot;) ~ &quot;China&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;Other countries&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(location = case_when( place == &quot;Hubei, Mainland China&quot; ~ &quot;Hubei (Wuhan)&quot;, country == &quot;China&quot; ~ &quot;Other China&quot;, # what happens when this line is not commented out? # why is it written this way? # str_detect(place, &quot;ruise&quot;) ~ &quot;Cruise Ship&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;Elsewhere&quot;)) %&gt;% group_by(location,reportDate) %&gt;% summarize(Confirmed = sum(Confirmed), Deaths = sum(Deaths), Recovered = sum(Recovered)) %&gt;% ungroup() 6.4.4 An initial plot The first plot is simple, including data for only deaths.

What problems did you encounter? What parts need to be annotated more? Can you reverse-engineer my code? Where is it confusing? (remember the 15 minute rule). What is the relationship between ‘confirmed cases’ and ‘deaths’? Which appears to be increasing more quickly? Is this cause for optimism? Can you improve on these plots? Some more challenging questions. What is (roughly) the shape of the function for each of the three variables, and for China/Other? What values would you expect for, say, ten days from now? 6.4.9 Additional notes If you are interested in looking at additional epidemiological datasets and how they might be looked at in R, consider this source by Tomás J.

This week, we move to a brief discussion of principles of statistics. 7.1 on probability Discrete probability is used to understand the likelihood of categorical events. We can think of initial estimates of probability as subjective or personal. For some events (what is the probability this plane will crash?), an estimate of probability can be drawn from a base rate or relative frequency (e.g., p(this plane will crash) = (number of flights with crashes/ number of flights)). For other events (what is the probability that the US President will resign or be impeached before completing his term of office?), it may be hard to arrive at a suitable base rate. Here, a number of subjective beliefs or principles may be combined to arrive at a subjective or personal probability. In a sense, all probability estimates begin with a personal belief such as this, in part because the choice of the most informative base rate is often not self-evident - in the plane crash example, maybe we should consider a reference group rates such as ‘for this airline’ etc. (Lanning 1987). The personal origins of probability estimates should become less important as we are exposed to data and revise our estimates in accordance with Bayes theorem. But over the last 45 years, a substantial body of evidence has demonstrates that, under at least some circumstances, we don’t make estimates of probability in this way. (This material is discussed in the Thinking and Decision Making/Behavioral Economics class). There is a nice r markdown document discussing basic laws of probability at Harvard’s datasciencelabs repository: https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2018/blob/master/lectures/prob/discrete-probability.Rmd; it is included as an appendix to this chapter. 7.2 the rules of probability Here’s an introduction to the principles of probability. These are presented, with examples and code, in the appendix at the end of the chapter. I. For any event A, 0 &lt;= P (A) &lt;= 1 II. Let S be the sample space, or set of all possible outcomes. Then P(S) = 1, and P (not S) = 0. III. If P (A and B) = 0, then P (A or B) = P (A) + P (B). IV. P (A|B) = P (A and B)/ P (B) Principle III applies for mutually exclusive events, such as A = you are here this morning, B = you are at the beach this morning. For mutually exclusive (disjoint, disjunctive) events, the union is the sum of the two events. This is called the addition rule for disjoint events. A different rule applies for events that are mutually independent, such as (A = I toss a coin and it lands on ‘Heads’) and (B = it will rain tomorrow). What we mean by independent is that our estimates of the probability of one don’t change based on the state of the other - your estimate of the likelihood of rain shouldn’t depend on my coin flip. Here, you multiply rather than add: If P (A|B) = P (A), then P (A and B) = P (A) P (B). In words - if the probability of A given B equals the probability of A, then the probability of both A and B equals the probability of A times the probability of B. Ask yourself - are mutually exclusive events independent? Come up with your own examples. This multiplication rule is handy for estimating the probability of an outcome that happens following a chain of independent events, such as the probability that the next eight times I toss a coin it will land on “tails” every time: P (TTTTTTTT) = P (T) P (T) P (T) P (T) P (T) P (T) P (T) P (T). = .58 = 1/256. Many sets of events are neither disjoint nor independent, so we need more general ways of thinking about pairs of events. For most of us, Venn diagrams are useful to think about combining probabilities. The union or P (A U B) describes the probability that A, B, or both of these will occur. Here, you will use the general addition rule: P (A or B) = P (A) + P (B) - P (A and B) (the probability of A or B is the probability of A plus the probability of B minus the probability of both A and B). For the intersection or P (A ∩ B), we need to consider conditional probabilities. Think of the probability of two events sequentially: First, what’s the probability of A? Second, what’s the probability of B, given that A has occurred? Multiply these to get the likelihood of A and B: P (A and B) = P (A) P (B|A). Example: The probability of you and your roommate both getting mononucleosis equals the probability of your getting mono times the probability that your roommate gets it, given that you have it also. This is the general multiplication rule. In this abstract example, the order is irrelevant. To estimate the likelihood of A and B, we could as easily take the probability of B, and multiply it by the conditional probability of A given B P (A and B) = P (B) P (A|B). Use the mono example again. What are A and B here? Does it still make sense? When might P (B|A) make more sense than P (A|B)? We are often interested in estimating conditional probabilities, in which case we’ll use the same equation, but solve instead for P (A|B). This leads us back to principle IV: IV. P (A|B) = P (A and B)/ P (B) What is the likelihood of getting in an accident (A), given that one is driving on I-95 (B)? How would you estimate this? If there are fewer accidents on Military Trail, does this mean that you would be safer there? 7.2.1 keeping conditional probabilities straight In general, P (B|A) and P (A|B) are not equivalent. Moore’s (2000) Basic Practice of Statistics gives the example of P (Police car | Crown Victoria) = .7, and P (Crown Vic | Police car) = .85. Here, one could use an asymmetrical Venn diagram (see the code at the end of Chapter 5) to model this asymmetry. Consider adapting that code for this problem, or at the very least make a rough sketch that can help you answer the following question: &gt; In general, if P (A|B) &lt; P (B|A), what must be true of the relationship of P (A) to P (B)? 7.3 continuous probability distributions We can also use probability with continuous variables such as systolic blood pressure (that’s the first one), which has a mean of approximately 120 and a standard deviation of 15. Continuous probability distributions are handy tools for thinking about the meaning of scores, particularly when we express scores in standard deviations from the mean (z scores). More to the point, this way of thinking about probability is widely used in questions of scientific inference, as, for example, in testing hypotheses such that “the average systolic blood pressure among a group of people studying at Crux (hence caffeinated) will be significantly greater than that of the population as a whole.” This is part of the logic of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) - if the result in my Crux sample is sufficiently high, then I say that I have rejected the null hypothesis, and found data which support the hypothesis of interest. 7.4 the most dangerous equation Just as Tufte (2001) demonstrated that poor data visualizations can be dangerous, leading, for example, to the loss of life in the Challenger disaster, Wainer (2007) shows that a lack of statistical literacy is also “dangerous.” He argues that deMoivre’s equation is the most dangerous equation - this equation (for the standard error) shows that variability decreases with the square root of sample size. Other nominees include the linear regression equation (and, in particular, how coefficients may change or reverse when new variables are added) and regression to the mean. Regarding linear regression, Simpson’s paradox shows how the direction of regression coefficients may change when additional variables are added to a model. I would argue that, from the standpoint of psychology, ignorance of regression to the mean was arguably more ‘dangerous’ than ignorance about the central limit theorem and standard error, in particular because regression effects contribute to an overestimate of the effectiveness of punishment and an under-appreciation of the effectiveness of positive reinforcement as tools for behavior change (Hastie and Dawes 2010). 7.5 appendix: notes on discrete probability This section was downloaded from https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2018/blob/master/prob/discrete-probability.Rmd and run in R on February 3, 2019.

We start by covering some basic principles related to categorical data. The subset of probability is referred to as discrete probability. It will help us understand the probability theory we will later introduce for numeric and continuous data, which is much more common in data science applications. Discrete probability is more useful in card games and other games of chance and we use these as examples. 7.6.1 Relative Frequency The word probability is used in everyday language. For example, Google’s auto-complete of “What are the chances of” give us “getting pregnant”, “having twins”, and “rain today”. Answering questions about probability is often hard if not impossible. Here we discuss a mathematical definition of probability that does permit us to give precise answers to certain questions. For example, if I have 2 red beads and 3 blue beads inside an urn and I pick one at random, what is the probability of picking a red one? Our intuition tells us that the answer is 2/5 or 40%. A precise definition can be given by noting that there are five possible outcomes of which two satisfy the condition necessary for the event “pick a red bead”. Because each of the five outcomes has the same chance of occurring we conclude that the probability is 0.4 for red and 0.6 for blue. A more tangible way to think about the probability of an event is as the proportion of times the event occurs when we repeat the experiment over and over, independently, and under the same conditions. 7.6.2 Notation We use the notation \\(\\mbox{Pr}(A)\\) to denote the probability of event \\(A\\) happening. We use the very general term event to refer to things that can happen when something happens by chance. For example, in our previous example the event was “picking a red bead”. In a political poll in which we call 100 likely voters at random, an example of an event is “calling 48 Democrats and 52 Republicans”. In data science applications, we will often deal with continuous variables. In these cases events will often be things like “is this person taller than 6 feet”. In this case we write events in a more mathematical form: \\(X \\geq 6\\). We will see more of these examples later. Here we focus on categorical data. 7.6.3 Monte Carlo Simulations Computers provide a way to actually perform the simple random experiment described above: pick a bead at random from a bag with three blue beads and two red ones. Random number generators permit us to mimic the process of picking at random. An example is the sample function in R. We demonstrate its use in the code below. First, we use the function rep to generate the urn: beads &lt;- rep(c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), times = c(2,3)) beads ## [1] &quot;red&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;blue&quot; and then use sample to pick a bead at random: sample(beads, 1) ## [1] &quot;red&quot; This line of code produces one random outcome. We want to repeat this experiment “over and over”. However, it is of course impossible to repeat forever. Instead, we repeat the experiment a large enough number of times to make the results practically equivalent. This is an example of a Monte Carlo simulation. Note that much of what mathematical and theoretical statisticians study, something we do not cover in this course, relates to providing rigorous definitions of “practically equivalent” as well as studying how close a large number of experiments gets us to what happens in the limit. Later in this lecture we provide a practical approach to deciding what is “large enough”. To perform our first Monte Carlo simulation we use the replicate function, which permits us to repeat the same task any number of times. Here we repeat the random event \\(B=\\) 10,000 times: B &lt;- 10000 events &lt;- replicate(B, sample(beads, 1)) We can now see if in fact, our definition is in agreement with this Monte Carlo simulation approximation. We can use table to see the distribution: tab &lt;- table(events) tab ## events ## blue red ## 6065 3935 and prop.table gives us the proportions: prop.table(tab) ## events ## blue red ## 0.6065 0.3935 The numbers above are the estimated probabilities provided by this Monte Carlo simulation. Statistical theory, not covered here, tells us the as \\(B\\) gets larger, the estimates get closer to 3/5 = 0.6 for blue and 2/5 = 0.4 for red. This is a simple and not very useful example, but we will use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate probabilities in cases in which it is harder to compute the exact ones. Before we go into more complex examples we use simple ones to demonstrate the computing tools available in R. 7.6.4 With and without replacement The function sample has an argument that permits us to pick more than one element from the urn. However, by default, this selection occurs without replacement: after a bead is selected, it is not put back in the bag. Note what happens when we ask to randomly select five beads: sample(beads, 5) ## [1] &quot;red&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;blue&quot; sample(beads, 5) ## [1] &quot;red&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;blue&quot; sample(beads, 5) ## [1] &quot;red&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;blue&quot; This results in re-arrangements that always have three blue and two red beads. If we ask that six beads be selected, we get an error sample(beads, 6) Error in sample.int(length(x), size, replace, prob) : cannot take a sample larger than the population when 'replace = FALSE' However, the sample function can be used directly, without the use of replicate, to repeat the same experiment of picking one out of the 5 beads, over and over, under the same conditions. To do this we sample with replacement: return the bead back to the urn after selecting it. We can tell sample to do this by changing the replace argument, which defaults as FALSE, to replace = TRUE: events &lt;- sample(beads, B, replace = TRUE) prop.table(table(events)) ## events ## blue red ## 0.596 0.404 Note that, not surprisingly, we get results very similar to those previously obtained with replicate. 7.6.5 Probability Distributions Defining a distribution for categorical outcomes is relatively straight forward. We simply assign a probability to each category. In cases that can be thought of as beads in an urn, for each bead type their proportion defines the distribution. If we are randomly calling likely voters from a population that is 44% Democrat, 44% Republican, 10% undecided and 2% Green party, these proportions define the probability for each group. The probability distribution is: \\[ \\mbox{Pr}(\\mbox{picking a Republican})=0.44\\\\ \\mbox{Pr}(\\mbox{picking a Democrat})=0.44\\\\ \\mbox{Pr}(\\mbox{picking an undecided})=0.10\\\\ \\mbox{Pr}(\\mbox{picking a Green})=0.02\\\\ \\] 7.6.6 Independence We say two events are independent if the outcome of one does not affect the other. The classic example are coin tosses. Every time we toss a fair coin the probability of seeing heads is 1/2 regardless of what previous tosses have revealed. The same is true when we pick beads from an urn with replacement. In the example above the probability of red is 0.40 regardless of previous draws. Many examples of events that are not independent come from card games. When we deal the first card, the probability of getting a king is 1/13 since there are 13 possibilities: Ace, Deuce, Three, \\(\\dots\\), Ten, Jack, Queen, and King, and there are 4 of each possibility (for the 4 suits hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs), totaling 52 cards. Now if we deal a king for the first card, and don’t replace it into the deck, the probability of a second card being a king is less because there are only three kings left: the probability is 3 out of 51. These events are therefore not independent. The first outcome affects the next. To see an extreme case of non-independent events, consider our example of drawing five beads at random without replacement: ## [1] &quot;R&quot; &quot;R&quot; x &lt;- sample(beads, 5) x &lt;- sample(beads, 5) If you have to guess the color of the first bead you predict blue since blue has a 60% chance. But if I show you the result of the last four outcomes: x[2:5] ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;red&quot; would you still guess blue? Of course not. Now you know that the probability of red is 1 since only a red bead remains. The events are not independent so the probabilities change. 7.6.7 Conditional Probabilities When events are not independent, conditional probabilities are useful. We already saw an example of a conditional probability: we computed the probability that a second dealt card is a king given that the first was a king. In probability we use the following notation: \\[ \\mbox{Pr}(\\mbox{Card 2 is a king} \\mid \\mbox{Card 1 is a king}) = 3/51 \\] We use the \\(\\mid\\) as shorthand for “given that” or “conditional on”. Note that when two events, say \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), are independent we have \\[ \\mbox{Pr}(A \\mid B) = \\mbox{Pr}(A) \\] This is the mathematical way of saying: the fact that \\(B\\) happened does not affect the probability of \\(A\\) happening. In fact, this can be considered the mathematical definition of independence. 7.7 Multiplication rule (see attribution in 7.5) If we want to know the probability of two events, say \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), occurring, we can use the multiplication rule. \\[ \\mbox{Pr}(A \\mbox{ and } B) = \\mbox{Pr}(A)\\mbox{Pr}(B \\mid A) \\] Let’s use Black Jack as an example. In Black Jack you get assigned two random cards. After you see what you have, you can ask for more. The goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer, without going over. Number cards 2-10 are worth their number in points, face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) are worth 10 points and aces worth 11 or 1 (you choose). So, in a black jack game, to calculate the chances of getting a 21 in the following way by drawing an ace and then a face card, we compute the probability of the first being an ace and multiply by the probability of a face card given that the first was an ace: \\(1/13 \\times 12/51 \\approx 0.018\\) The multiplicative rule also applies to more than two events. We can use induction to expand for more events: \\[ \\mbox{Pr}(A \\mbox{ and } B \\mbox{ and } C) = \\mbox{Pr}(A)\\mbox{Pr}(B \\mid A)\\mbox{Pr}(C \\mid A \\mbox{ and } B) \\] 7.7.0.1 Multiplication rule under independence When we have independent events then the multiplication rule becomes simpler: \\[ \\mbox{Pr}(A \\mbox{ and } B \\mbox{ and } C) = \\mbox{Pr}(A)\\mbox{Pr}(B)\\mbox{Pr}(C) \\] But we have to be very careful before using this, as assuming independence can result in very different, and incorrect, probability calculations when we don’t actually have independence. As an example, imagine a court case in which the suspect was described to have a mustache and a beard. The defendant has a mustache and a beard and the prosecution brings in an “expert” to testify that 1/10 men have beards and 1/5 have mustaches so using the multiplication rule we conclude that only \\(1/10 \\times 1/5\\) or 0.02 have both. But to multiply like this we need to assume independence! The conditional probability of a man having a mustache conditional on them having a beard is .95. So the correct calculation probability is much higher: 0.09. Note that the multiplication rule also gives us a general formula for computing conditional probabilities: \\[ \\mbox{Pr}(B \\mid A) = \\frac{\\mbox{Pr}(A \\mbox{ and } B)}{ \\mbox{Pr}(A)} \\] To illustrate how we use these formulas and concepts in practice we will show several examples related to card games. 7.7.1 Combinations and Permutations In our very first example we imagined an urn with five beads. Let’s review how we did this. To compute the probability distribution of one draw, we simply listed out all the possibilities, there were 5, and then, for each event, counted how many of these possibilities were associated with the event. So, for example, because out of the five possible outcomes, three were blue, the probability of blue is 3/5. For more complicated examples these computations are not straightforward. For example, what is the probability that if I draw five cards without replacement I get all cards of the same suit; what is called a flush in poker? In a Discrete Probability course you learn theory on how to make these kinds of computations. Here we focus on how to use R code to compute the answers. First let’s construct a deck of cards. For this we will use the expand.grid and paste functions. We use paste to create strings by joining smaller strings. For example, if we have the number and suit of a card we create the card name like this: number &lt;- &quot;Three&quot; suit &lt;- &quot;Hearts&quot; paste(number, suit) ## [1] &quot;Three Hearts&quot; paste also works on pairs of vectors performing the operation element-wise: paste(letters[1:5], as.character(1:5)) ## [1] &quot;a 1&quot; &quot;b 2&quot; &quot;c 3&quot; &quot;d 4&quot; &quot;e 5&quot; The function expand.grid gives us all the combinations of entries of two vectors. For example if you have blue and black pants and white, grey and plaid shirts all your combinations are: expand.grid(pants = c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;), shirt = c(&quot;white&quot;, &quot;grey&quot;, &quot;plaid&quot;)) ## pants shirt ## 1 blue white ## 2 black white ## 3 blue grey ## 4 black grey ## 5 blue plaid ## 6 black plaid So here is how we generate a deck of cards: suits &lt;- c(&quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Spades&quot;) numbers &lt;- c(&quot;Ace&quot;, &quot;Deuce&quot;, &quot;Three&quot;, &quot;Four&quot;, &quot;Five&quot;, &quot;Six&quot;, &quot;Seven&quot;, &quot;Eight&quot;, &quot;Nine&quot;, &quot;Ten&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;King&quot;) deck &lt;- expand.grid(number=numbers, suit=suits) deck &lt;- paste(deck$number, deck$suit) With the deck constructed, we can now double check that the probability of drawing a king as the first card is 1/13. We simply compute the proportion of possible outcomes that satisfy our condition: kings &lt;- paste(&quot;King&quot;, suits) mean(deck %in% kings) ## [1] 0.07692308 which is 1/13. Now, how about the conditional probability of the second card being a king given that the first was a king ? Earlier we deduced that if one king is already out of the deck and there are 51 left then this probability is 3/51. Let’s confirm by listing out all possible outcomes. To do this we can use the permutations function from the gtools package. This function computes, for any list of size n, all the different combinations we can get when we select r items. So here are all the ways we can chose 2 numbers from a list consisting of 1,2,3: library(gtools) permutations(3, 2) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 2 ## [2,] 1 3 ## [3,] 2 1 ## [4,] 2 3 ## [5,] 3 1 ## [6,] 3 2 Notice that the order matters here: 3, 1 is different than 1,3. Also note that (1,1), (2,2) and (3,3) don’t appear because once we pick a number it can’t appear again. Optionally, we can add a vector. So if you want to see five random seven digit phone numbers, out of all possible phone numbers you could type: all_phone_numbers &lt;- permutations(10, 7, v = 0:9) n &lt;- nrow(all_phone_numbers) index &lt;- sample(n, 5) all_phone_numbers[index,] Instead of using the numbers 1 through 10, the default, it uses what we provided through v: the digits 0 through 9. To compute all possible ways we can chose two cards, when the order matters, we type: hands &lt;- permutations(52, 2, v = deck) This is a matrix with two columns and 2652 rows. With a matrix we can get the first and second card like this: first_card &lt;- hands[,1] second_card &lt;- hands[,2] Now the cases for which the first card was a king can be computed like this: kings &lt;- paste(&quot;King&quot;, suits) sum(first_card %in% kings) ## [1] 204 To get the conditional probability we compute what fraction of these have a king in the second card: sum(first_card %in% kings &amp; second_card %in% kings) / sum(first_card %in% kings) ## [1] 0.05882353 which is exactly 3/51 as we had already deduced. Note that the code above is equivalent to mean(first_card %in% kings &amp; second_card %in% kings) / mean(first_card %in% kings) ## [1] 0.05882353 which uses mean instead of sum and is an R version of \\[ \\frac{\\mbox{Pr}(A \\mbox{ and } B)}{ \\mbox{Pr}(A)} \\] Now what if the order does not matter? For example, in Black Jack if you get an Ace and face card in the first draw it is called a Natural 21 and you win automatically. If we want to compute the probability of this happening we want to enumerate the combinations, not the permutations, since the order does not matter. Note the differences: permutations(3,2) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 2 ## [2,] 1 3 ## [3,] 2 1 ## [4,] 2 3 ## [5,] 3 1 ## [6,] 3 2 combinations(3,2) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 2 ## [2,] 1 3 ## [3,] 2 3 In the second line the outcome does not include (2,1) because the (1,2) already was enumerated. Similarly for (3,1) and (3,2). So to compute the probability of a Natural 21 in Blackjack we can do this: aces &lt;- paste(&quot;Ace&quot;, suits) facecard &lt;- c(&quot;King&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Ten&quot;) facecard &lt;- expand.grid(number = facecard, suit = suits) facecard &lt;- paste(facecard$number, facecard$suit) hands &lt;- combinations(52, 2, v = deck) mean(hands[,1] %in% aces &amp; hands[,2] %in% facecard) ## [1] 0.04826546 Note that in the last line we assume the ace comes first. This is only because we know the way combination enumerates possibilities and it will list this case first. But to be safe we could have written this to get the same answer: mean((hands[,1] %in% aces &amp; hands[,2] %in% facecard) | (hands[,2] %in% aces &amp; hands[,1] %in% facecard)) ## [1] 0.04826546 7.7.1.1 Monte Carlo Example Instead of using combinations to deduce the exact probability of a Natural 21 we can use a Monte Carlo to estimate this probability. In this case we draw two cards over and over and keep track of how many 21s we get. We can use the function sample to draw two cards without replacement: hand &lt;- sample(deck, 2) hand ## [1] &quot;Ten Clubs&quot; &quot;Four Spades&quot; And then check if one card is an ace and the other a face card or a 10. Going forward we include 10 when we say face card. Now we need to check both possibilities: (hands[1] %in% aces &amp; hands[2] %in% facecard) | (hands[2] %in% aces &amp; hands[1] %in% facecard) ## [1] FALSE If we repeat this 10,000 times, we get a very good approximation of the probability of a Natural 21. Let’s start by writing a function that draws a hand and returns TRUE if we get a 21. The function does not need any arguments because it uses objects defined in the global environment. blackjack &lt;- function(){ hand &lt;- sample(deck, 2) (hand[1] %in% aces &amp; hand[2] %in% facecard) | (hand[2] %in% aces &amp; hand[1] %in% facecard) } Note that here we do have to check both possibilities: Ace first or Ace second because we are not using the combinations function. The function returns TRUE if we get a 21 and FALSE otherwise: blackjack() ## [1] FALSE Now we can play this game, say, 10,000 times: B &lt;- 10000 results &lt;- replicate(B, blackjack()) mean(results) ## [1] 0.047 7.7.2 Birthday Problem Suppose you are in a classroom with 50 people. If we assume this is a randomly selected group of 50 people, what is the chance that at least two people have the same birthday? Although it is somewhat advanced, we can deduce this mathematically. We do this later. Here we use a Monte Carlo simulation. For simplicity, we assume nobody was born on February 29. This actually doesn’t change the answer much. First note that birthdays can be represented as numbers between 1 and 365, so a sample of 50 birthdays can be obtained like this: n &lt;- 50 bdays &lt;- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE) To check if in this particular set of 50 people we have at least two with the same birthday we can use the function duplicated which returns TRUE whenever an element of a vector is a duplicate. Here is an example: duplicated(c(1,2,3,1,4,3,5)) ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE The second time 1 and 3 appear we get a TRUE. So to check if two birthdays were the same we simply use the any and duplicated functions like this: any(duplicated(bdays)) ## [1] TRUE In this case, we see that it did happen. At least two people had the same birthday. bdays ## [1] 324 167 129 299 270 187 307 85 277 362 330 263 329 79 213 37 105 217 165 ## [20] 290 362 89 289 340 326 330 42 111 20 44 343 70 121 40 172 25 248 198 ## [39] 39 298 280 160 14 130 45 22 206 230 193 104 7.7.3 sapply: a better way to do for loops Say we want to use this knowledge to bet with friends about two people having the same birthday in a group of people. When are the chances larger than 50%? Larger the 75%? Let’s create a look-up table. We can quickly create a function to compute this for any group size: same_birthday &lt;- function(n){ bdays &lt;- sample(1:365, n, replace=TRUE) any(duplicated(bdays)) } compute_prob &lt;- function(n, B=10000){ results &lt;- replicate(B, same_birthday(n)) mean(results) } And now we can use a for-loop to run it for several group sizes: n &lt;- seq(1,60) Now, for-loops are rarely the preferred approach in R. In general, we try to perform operations on entire vectors. Arithmetic operations, for example, operate on vectors in an element-wise fashion: x &lt;- 1:10 sqrt(x) ## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 2.828427 ## [9] 3.000000 3.162278 y &lt;- 1:10 x*y ## [1] 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 No need for for-loops. But not all functions work this way. For example, the function we just wrote does not work element-wise since it is expecting a scalar (just one number). This piece of code does not run the function on each entry of n: compute_prob(n) The function sapply permits us to perform element-wise operations on any function. Here is how it works: x &lt;- 1:10 sapply(x, sqrt) ## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 2.828427 ## [9] 3.000000 3.162278 It loops through the elements of the first argument of sapply and sends those as values to first argument of the function specified as the second argument to sapply. So for our case we can simply type: prob &lt;- sapply(n, compute_prob) We can now make a plot of the estimated probabilities of two people having the same birthday in a group of size \\(n\\): prob &lt;- sapply(n, compute_prob) plot(n, prob) 7.7.4 How many Monte Carlo experiments are enough In the examples above we used \\(B=\\) 10,000 Monte Carlo experiments. It turns out that this provided very accurate estimates. But in more complex calculations, 10,000 may not be nearly enough. Also for some calculations, 10,000 experiments might not be computationally feasible. In practice we won’t know what the answer is so we won’t know if our Monte Carlo estimate is accurate. We know that the larger \\(B\\) is, the better the approximation. But how big do we need it to be? This is actually a challenging question and answering it often requires advanced theoretical statistics training. One practical approach we will describe here is to check for the stability of the estimate. Here is an example with the birthday problem for a group of 25 people. B &lt;- 10^seq(1, 5, len = 100) compute_prob &lt;- function(B, n=25){ same_day &lt;- replicate(B, same_birthday(n)) mean(same_day) } prob &lt;- sapply(B, compute_prob) plot(log10(B), prob, type = &quot;l&quot;) In this plot we can see that the values start to stabilize, (vary less than .01), around 1000. Note that the exact probability, which we know in this case, is: exact_prob &lt;- function(n){ prob_unique &lt;- seq(365,365-n+1)/365 1 - prod( prob_unique) } eprob &lt;- sapply(n, exact_prob) eprob[25] ## [1] 0.5686997 7.7.5 Addition Rule Another way to compute the probability of a Natural 21 is to notice that it is the probability of an ace followed by a facecard or a facecard followed by an ace. Here we use the addition rule \\[ \\mbox{Pr}(A \\mbox{ or } B) = \\mbox{Pr}(A) + \\mbox{Pr}(B) - \\mbox{Pr}(A \\mbox{ and } B) \\] This rule is intuitive: think of a Venn diagram. If we simply add the probabilities we count the intersection twice. ## (polygon[GRID.polygon.188], polygon[GRID.polygon.189], polygon[GRID.polygon.190], polygon[GRID.polygon.191], text[GRID.text.192], text[GRID.text.193], text[GRID.text.194], text[GRID.text.195], text[GRID.text.196]) In the case of Natural 21 the intersection is empty since both hands can’t happen simultaneously. The probability of an ace followed by a face card is \\(1/13 \\times 16/51\\) and the probability of a face card followed by an ace is \\(16/52 \\times 4/51\\). These two are actually the same which makes sense due to symmetry. In any case we get the same result using the addition rule: 1/13*16/51 + 16/52*4/51 - 0 ## [1] 0.04826546 7.7.6 Monty Hall Problem In the 1970s there was a game show called “Let’s Make a Deal”. Monty Hall was the host. At some point in the game contestants were asked to pick one of three doors. Behind one door there was a prize. The other doors had a goat to show you had lost. After the contestant chose a door, Monty Hall would open one of the two remaining doors and show the contestant there was no prize. Then he would ask, “Do you want to switch doors?” What would you do? We can use probability to show that if you stick to the original door your chances of winning a prize are 1 in 3 but if you switch, your chances double to 2 in 3! This seems counterintuitive. Many people incorrectly think both chances are 1 in 2 since you are choosing between 2. You can watch a detailed explanation here or read one here. Here we use a Monte Carlo simulation to see which strategy is better. Note that this code is written longer than it should be for pedagogical purposes. Let’s start with the stick strategy: B &lt;- 10000 stick &lt;- replicate(B, { doors &lt;- as.character(1:3) prize &lt;- sample(c(&quot;car&quot;,&quot;goat&quot;,&quot;goat&quot;)) prize_door &lt;- doors[prize == &quot;car&quot;] my_pick &lt;- sample(doors, 1) show &lt;- sample(doors[!doors %in% c(my_pick, prize_door)],1) stick &lt;- my_pick stick == prize_door }) mean(stick) ## [1] 0.3256 As we write the code we note that the lines starting with my_pick and show have no influence on the last logical operation. From this we should realize that the chance is 1 in 3, what we started out with. Now let’s repeat the exercise but consider the switch strategy: switch &lt;- replicate(B, { doors &lt;- as.character(1:3) prize &lt;- sample(c(&quot;car&quot;,&quot;goat&quot;,&quot;goat&quot;)) prize_door &lt;- doors[prize == &quot;car&quot;] my_pick &lt;- sample(doors, 1) show &lt;- sample(doors[!doors %in% c(my_pick, prize_door)], 1) stick &lt;- my_pick switch &lt;- doors[!doors%in%c(my_pick, show)] switch == prize_door }) mean(switch) ## [1] 0.6619 The Monte Carlo estimate confirms the 2/3 calculation. This helps us gain some insight by showing that we are removing a door, show, that is definitely not a winner from our choices. We also see that unless we get it right when we first pick, you win: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the time. references "],

But philosophers of science have long recognized that this is not really how science works (Lakatos 1969). That is, science is not primarily built by the testing and rejecting of null hypotheses. (Think, for example, of how you might describe an experiment for testing the hypothesis that gravity exists, and whether you would ever reject this hypothesis). The problem is a multifaceted one. It arises partly because, in any experiment, there is a large (infinite?) number of conditions which might be invoked to explain-away results of a failure of our work. It arises because we are human, and prone to various biases of decision making and information integration (that is, we are poor Bayesians). It arises, too, because scientific institutions such as journals, funding agencies, and universities are competitive environments which incentivize positive findings. In recent years, the tension between the false ideal of NHST and the real world of science has become increasingly evident. Within psychology, experimental studies have often - even typically - failed to replicate well-known results (Collaboration and others 2015). It’s not just psychology (Baker 2016). One of the first important papers to shine light in the area (Ioannidis 2005) came from medicine; it suggested six contributing factors, which I quote verbatim here: The smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. This stems directly from our discussion of the central limit theorem and the instability of results from small samples. The smaller the effect sizes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true We’ll talk about effect size below. The greater the number and the lesser the selection of tested relationships in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. (and) The greater the flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. The “problem” of analytic flexibility leads to ‘p-hacking’ The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true and The hotter a scientific field (with more scientific teams involved), the less likely the research findings are to be true. Positive findings rise, and negative ones are ignored. And scientists are human, and subject to incentives. Here’s a video which provides some more context for the crisis: . *Video 8.1: On the reproducibility crisis (12 mins) 8.1 Answers to the reproducibility crisis For scientific progress to occur, there needs to be more than a simple rejection of what is wrong with current methods and research programs: Here, as elsewhere, criticism must be constructive to be valuable. There have been a number of solutions proposed to the reproducibility crisis. 8.1.1 Tweak or abandon NHST The first cluster of responses to the reproducibility crisis is concerned with statistics, specifically problems with Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST). These include (a) justifying one’s alpha - making it more stringent, for example, for counter-intuitive claims (Grange et al. 2018), (b) changing the default p value from .05 to .005 (Benjamin et al. 2017), and (c) abandoning significance testing altogether (McShane et al. 2017). Szucs and Ioannidis (2017) goes into some of these issues in more detail and discusses other limitations of significance testing, including the dichotomous, all-or-none silliness of the accept/reject decision. (If you play the NHST game, there is no ‘almost’ significant, ‘approached significance,’ ‘highly significant’, etc.). Leek and Peng (2015) argue that the problems are not merely with NHST, but with the whole of data analysis. They maintain that better training in data science - courses like ours, perhaps, are part of the answer. (figure) Munafò et al. (2017) also argue that threats to reproducible science occur at a number of places in science, not just with the evaluation of hypotheses. munafo2017threats 8.1.2 Keep a log of every step of every analysis in R markdown or Jupyter notebooks A second cluster of responses is concerned with keeping good records. Let’s say that you are running a study, say, which looks at the hypothesis of differential variation of females and males in a cognitive measure; your interest is to critically examine the hypothesis discussed by Wainer (2007) that males show more variability. There have been a lot of studies related to this over the years, so that rather than collect new data you decide that you will work with existing data from several online archives. You find and download spreadsheets from two studies: In the first, gender is coded ‘1’ for male, ‘2’ for female. In the second, gender is coded ‘1’ for female, ‘2’ for male, and ‘3’ for other. There are, in essence, two ways that you can combine the variables into a common format: The first would be to take one of the spreadsheets and do a few find-and-replace commands on the appropriate column of the data. This is quick and easy - but when someone else, or even future you, returns to this data, you will not remember if you have recoded it. The alternative is to keep a record of your work in R markdown. This is more time consuming, and can sometimes be clumsy. But it is virtuous useful and clear - and when you screw up, you will have a full record of what happened. Part of the problem of scientific reproducibility is to keep comprehensive records. This record-keeping and research transparency is at the heart of R markdown documents. 8.2 Answers to the reproducibility crisis III: Pre-registration The third answer to the reproducibility crisis is the most comprehensive; it involves not merely keeping a record of what you have done, but preregistering your work, that is, fully specifying your planned analyses beforehand (Miguel et al. 2014). The author, an economist, outlines his argument in a five-minute video here. For randomized controlled trials, consider socialscienceregistry.org, and for more general use, use the open science framework page. 8.3 Further readings Finally, if you would like to learn more about the reproducibility crisis, there is a collection of papers in Nature here.

["literate-programming-with-r-markdown.html", "9 literate programming with R markdown 9.1 scripts are files of code 9.2 projects are directories containing related scripts 9.3 R markdown documents integrate rationale, script, and results 9.4 What to do when you are stuck", " 9 literate programming with R markdown Showing your work, to (future) you as well as others, is a key part of reproducible science. R Markdown documents facilitate this, as they allow you to include comments, code, and results in a single place. But before we consider R markdown, we begin with two more elemental ideas: scripts (R4DS, Chapter 6) and projects (Chapter 8). 9.1 scripts are files of code We begin with R4DS Chapter 6, which shows the R studio interface and encourages you to save your work using scripts, written in the source (editor) window in the upper left quadrant of the default R studio screen. Note the recommendations - for example, include packages (libraries) at the beginning of your code. One more thing - in setting up R studio, consider adjusting the “insert spaces for tab” setting to something more than 2. This will allow you to more easily see the nested structure of functions, loops, etc. - and will create a modest disincentive against making these nested structures too deep or complex: Fig 9.1: I use 4 spaces here. YMMV. Note, too, the code diagnostics in R. Consider enabling all of these, including the R style diagnostics, to help you keep your code readable: Fig 9.2: Enable code diagnostics 9.1.1 some elements of coding style Good coding is often a combination of several skills ranging from puzzle-solving to communication. I can’t claim that these are the elements of coding style (apologies to Strunk &amp; White), but rather that these are merely some of the elements. Good coding is clear and thus commented. You are writing for your future self as well as others, so be explicit about the purpose of each chunk of code. Good coding is concise. When you can write code in 3 lines instead of 30, your code may be more clear and efficient. Take pleasure in writing parsimonious, efficient code. But where efficiency and clarity conflict, choose the latter. Good code should be complete, including all steps from reading the data to producing output. Where appropriate, comment-out (rather than delete) informative errors, again for the future you. Good code may be creative. The coolest solutions are those which pull from and synthesize a number of ideas. Creativity often requires walking away from a problem in order to ultimately arrive at a solution (Wertheimer’s Productive Thinking). Finally, good code should be considered. Reflect on the impacts of your work - just because you can analyze something doesn’t mean that you should. 9.2 projects are directories containing related scripts You will save your work in projects - which isolate your data and scripts into different directories. (See r4ds, Chapter 8). To reinforce the idea that your unit of analysis in R is “the project” rather than “the script”, consider associating your Rmd filetype (see next section) with your markdown editor, and only your Rproj filetype with R studio. Soon, it is likely that you will soon be working on R for different things in parallel - for this and another class, for this class and your thesis, or perhaps for two distinct types of analysis within your thesis. When you open up an R project, you’ll be in the right directory, with the relevant files (and only the relevant files) at your fingertips in the files pane. 9.3 R markdown documents integrate rationale, script, and results R Markdown documents allow you to include comments, scripts, and results in a single place. The basics of R markdown are presented in Chapter 27 of R4DS. I encourage you to use R markdown for nearly everything you do in R. Within R studio, open up a new R markdown document. There are as many as four parts of an R markdown document: A YAML (yet another markdown language) header Text formatted in markdown R code (chunks) surrounded by code fences and, occasionally, inline code There is a handy R Markdown cheat sheet which can give you a sense of what R markdown is about. It describes eight steps, from “workflow” to “publish” (and a ninth, “learn more”). Don’t worry about all of the detail here, but do get a sense of how it works. Exercise 9.1: Working in groups, do the exercises in section 27.4.7 of R4DS. Begin with the R markdown file that is included at the beginning of Chapter 27. You can download it here. Study the code, and annotate it so that you have a better sense of how it works. For example, “this block loads needed libraries, then takes the _____dataset and ___________ .” Play with the graph. Change one or more parameters of it to make it more useful. Again, annotate your changes. 9.4 What to do when you are stuck Google. pay attention to your error messages Ask for help, make your questions clear and reproducible (see R4DS Chapter 1) Take a break, think outside the box and kludge something together if you have to Document your struggle and your cleverness for a future you "],
["the-tidyverse.html", "10 the tidyverse 10.1 some simple principles", " 10 the tidyverse The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science - https://www.tidyverse.org/ R had its origins in S, a system designed for engineers at Bell Labs. This audience meant that R would be more accessible to those with programming backgrounds, more aimed at “developers” than users approaching data science from an applied or statistical perspective than one in programming. As the popularity of R increased, it would become more flexible and versatile for these power users, but there was less progress in making R accessible to and tailored for data scientists. To this day, “base-R” is, for most users, more challenging than SPSS or Stata. The tidyverse was born partly to address these issues (Peng 2018). The tidyverse is a growing set of interconnected packages which share a common syntax; it can be seen as a dialect of R. More precisely, …the tidyverse is a lucid collection of R packages offering data science solutions in the areas of data manipulation, exploration, and visualization that share a common design philosophy. It was created by R industry luminary Hadley Wickham, the chief scientist behind RStudio. R packages in the tidyverse are intended to make statisticians and data scientists more productive. Packages guide them through workflows that facilitate communication and result in reproducible work products. The tidyverse essentially focuses on the interconnections of the tools that make the workflow possible [gutierrez2018tidyverse]. The workflow is one that you have seen here and in R4DS. In this 2017 slide, the main processes of data analysis are accompanied by the packages in the tidyverse. (As of 2019, there have been a few small changes in the packages associated with modeling). All of these are installed on your computer with install.packages(“tidyverse”), but only those in bold are loaded into memory when you issue the command library(tidyverse): Fig 10.1: Schematic of the tidyverse. From Wickham’s 2017 rstudio:conf keynote 10.1 some simple principles search for tidyverse solutions. When you have a problem in your code, for example, “how do I compute the mean for different groups of a variable,” search for R mean groups tidyverse, not just R mean groups. This will get you in the habit of working with tidy solutions where they can be found. library(tidyverse) mtcars %&gt;% group_by(cyl) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(disp), n = n()) (Another suggestion: Because R and the tidyverse are constantly evolving, consider looking at recent pages first. In your Google search bar, click on Tools -&gt; Past year). talk the talk. Recognize that %&gt;% (the pipe) means then. Statements with pipes begin with data, may include queries (extract, combine, arrange), and finish with a command. annotate your work. Assume that you will come back to it at a later date, while working on a different project, and use portions of your current code. Your R markdown documents should be a log. When you run in to a significant, challenging problem, don’t delete your mistakes, but ## comment them out. library(gapminder) b &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% ## when should you comment out an error ## instead of deleting it? for me, I&#39;ll ## comment out errors that took me a long time ## to solve, and/or that I&#39;ll learn from. ## Probably not here, in other words... ## filter(lifeExp) &gt; 70 bad parens filter(lifeExp &gt; 70) work with tidy data. Make each row an observation, and each column a variable. Complex data sets, such as samples of text, become much more manageable when reduced to simple arrays. write functions. If you repeat a section of code, rewrite it as a function. (We’ll come back to this later). adhere to good coding style. Well-written code is reasonably parsimonious, readable, and easily debugged. There are a few style manuals for R, including one from Hadley, and this [Rchaeological Commentary] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rockchalk/vignettes/Rstyle.pdf). but maintain perspective. Your need to solve problems (how to analyze x, etc.) should not take a back seat to your desire to write the best code. There is almost always a better way to do things. Strive reasonably to accomplish this, but be prepared to kludge. references "],

There is no shortage of datasets available to analyze, and each can give rise to a host of interesting analyses and insights, as we saw last week with the babynames library. What do you want to study? 11.1 Data in R libraries There are a number of R packages (libraries) which provide ‘easy’ access to data. One is the built-in R dataset library, which includes, at this writing, 101 different datasets. Another is the R dslabs library, with 42 additional datasets. And the R fivethirtyeight library provides access to 204 clever, clean, and largely manageable datasets, each of which underlies the empirical analyses and reports of Nate Silver and his team (You can learn more at https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/). The datasets in these libraries should be relatively easy to work with, requiring minimal munging prior to analysis. If you are up for something a little more ambitious, read on. 11.2 Other prepared datasets Less tidy, more ambitious, and more far-ranging datasets include the Nineteen datasets and sources, ranging from Census data to Yelp reviews, that can be found at https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/. Kaggle is a noun (a community, a website, a challenge), and a verb (to kaggle is to participate in a data challenge) which describes a crowdsourced competition to improve on a problem in prediction. Perhaps the first and best known example of this was the Netflix prize (Jackson 2017), which, in 2006, promised one million dollars to the first team to improve the algorithm by which that company recommended movies to its customer base. The competition took several years, and inspired substantial improvements in machine learning as well as in crowdsourced science. At this writing, Kaggle hosts many active competitions - including a $1,500,000 award offered by the United States Department of Homeland Security known as the “passenger screening algorithm challenge.” (Good luck!) Kaggle also hosts hundreds if not thousands of datasets. A good place to start is with their datasets stored in comma separated value format (.csv); you can find them here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv. Kaggling is an important feature of data science culture. Reddit, the meta-bulletin-board, includes a dataset subreddit where you may find less curated (i.e., potentially messier), topical datasets and discussions about data. Search for csv files here: https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/search?q=csv&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=top. If you are into psychology and behavioral science, the Open Science Framework (OSF) provides a system for hosting and sharing code and data from research articles. One OSF page may be of particular interest, and that is a compilation of many datasets from prominent papers in psychology and psychiatry (https://osf.io/r38qu/). Incidentally, almost all of the data and code from papers I have published is on the OSF as well. Outside of psychology, repositories of data from many disciplines may be found at Re3data https://www.re3data.org/. Proceed with caution - many of these datasets are likely to be quite large (for example, analyses of images) and/or in formats that for now are too challenging (JSON). Stick with data that are available in a .csv format and that don’t have more than, say, a million data points (e.g., 50,000 observations * 20 variables). There are many datasets about music - songs, artists, lyrics, etc. - at http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/additional-datasets/. Note that many of these are quite large, but there are “smaller” files of ~ 10000 songs that are available. Github is the primary site for coders to share and improve upon their work. Git is a system in which one can upload (push) one’s work from a local computer to the cloud in a repository (repo), share this with collaborators who copy (fork) the repo, pull it down to their computers, and possibly make changes which will appear as a separate branch of the repo. Each change is time-stamped, and efficiently stored as only its difference from the prior edit (or commit). There are, in all of these pushes and pulls, opportunities for collisions and problems, but learning Git remains a critical part of the data scientist’s toolkit. You can set up an account on Github if you like, but even without this you can access some of the datasets that are stored there, including a set of curated datasets on topics such as economics, demographics, air quality, flights and house prices at https://github.com/datasets/. Perhaps the easiest way to access these is to click through repos until you find a data directory, open the files up as ‘raw’ files, and paste them into a spreadsheet or notepad program of your choice. Github also hosts the ’awesome public datasets’ (many of which probably are) at https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets. You can work with R repositories straight from R studio. 11.3 Make/extract/combine your own data Despite the petabytes (exabytes? zettabytes? yottabytes?) of data in the datasets described above, it’s possible that the dataset that you want to examine does not yet exist. But you may be able to create it, for example, by scraping data from the Web. Typically, you would use an Application Programming Interface (API) to pull data down from platforms such as Twitter or Reddit. For these and other major social media and news platforms, there are R packages which will walk you through the process of getting the data from webpage to tidy dataset. (Be aware, though, that the methods for data access on these platforms frequently changes, so that code that worked a year ago might not work today). Another source of data is … your own life. If you wear a pedometer or sleep tracker, are a calorie counter or keep other logs as a member of the quantified self movement, consider how such data might relate to aspects of the physical environment (such as temperature, or the time between sunrise and sunset) and/or the broader social and cultural context (a measure, perhaps of the sentiment, or mood, of news articles from papers like the NY Times). Finally, you might want to combine multiple datasets, such as county-level home pricing data from Zillow (https://www.zillow.com/research/data/), county-level elections data from, for example, here: https://github.com/tonmcg/US_County_Level_Election_Results_08-16, and the boundaries of Woodard’s 11 American Nations (see Lanning). In joining different datasets, or data from different sources, we can go beyond a pedagogical exercise (learning about learning) and contribute new and meaningful knowledge. 11.4 exploring data To look at the datasets in the prior section, remember that there are a few key commands, which are here applied to the gapminder dataset: library(gapminder) library(tidyverse) str(gapminder) head(gapminder) summary(gapminder) To simplify your data, you’ll want to select certain columns or rows, or possibly create new variables based on existing scores: gapminder %&gt;% filter(gdpPercap &lt; 100 &amp; year &gt; 2000) gapminder %&gt;% select(-(c(continent,pop))) gapminder %&gt;% mutate(size = ifelse(pop &lt; 10e06, &quot;small&quot;, &quot;large&quot;)) 11.5 messy data: Cleaning and curation Between 50 and 80% of the work of the data scientist consists of the compiling, cleaning and curation of data, or what is called data munging or wrangling. One part of data wrangling is looking for and dealing with encoding inconsistencies, missing values, and errors. Consider the following: Exercise 11.1 Run the following code in an R markdown document. You’ll need to add a library beforehand. car2019 &lt;- tibble(“model” = c(“Corolla”, “Prius”, “Camry”, “Avalon”), “price” = c(22.5, “about 25K” , 24762, “33000-34000”)) Inspect the data frame. Add and annotate code to fix any problems that you believe exist. Summarize the results. Another part of data wrangling is about data rectangling (Bryan 2017), that is, getting diverse types of data into a data frame (specifically, a tibble). This is likely to be particularly challenging when you are combining data from different sources, including Web APIs. We’ll consider this further down the road when we talk about lists. A third part of data wrangling occurs when we join data from different sources. There are many ways to do this, but attention must be paid to insure that the observations line up correctly, that the same metrics are used for different datasets (for example, inflation adjusted dollars vs raw), that dates are interpreted as dates, that missing values are recognized as missing and not scored as zero, and so forth. We’ll talk about this in the weeks ahead, particularly when we consider relational data. references "],

In R, there is a general purpose tool (ok, package) that exists for this called dplyr (“d-plier”). Play with the various dplyr functions. Experiment. You will not break the internet Fig 12.1 - pliers to play with Dplyr is a core part of the tidyverse and hence is loaded automatically when you load the tidyverse ensemble of libraries: library(tidyverse) library(maps) library(maptools) The versatility of dplyr is demonstrated in Chapter 5 of R4DS, which shows how to do many basic, and some not so basic, operations on your data. Read it closely if you haven’t already done so. 12.1 from data on the web to data in R Let’s consider a dataset consisting of 10,000 songs (observations) and 35 measures (variables including artist). The first step here (and for your class project and the data science challenge) will be to get the data into R. How do you this? Method 1: Download the file to your computer as a csv file. Some advantages of this include (a) it will allow the code to run even if the website changes or disappears, (b) in the likely event that I will run the code several times, it is faster to get data from my own machine than from the cloud, and (c) if there are any anomalies in the data I can look at them locally (e.g., in Notepad++). If you use this approach, make sure that you know where your data is on your computer. The easiest way to do this is to work with an R project. Within R studio, create a new R project (or use an existing one). Move the csv file into this directory, so that data, code, and results will all be in the same place. Method 2: Import the data from the cloud directly into R. You can do this either by specifying the musicURL separately (Method 2a) or call it directly within the read_csv statement (2b). Here, too, I would encourage you to set up and work within a project. ### Method 1 # music1 &lt;- read_csv(&quot;music.csv&quot;) ### Method 2a musicURL &lt;- &quot;https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/datasets/csv/music/music.csv?forcedownload=1&quot; music1 &lt;- read_csv(musicURL) ### Method 2b # music1 &lt;- read_csv( # &quot;https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/music/music.csv?forcedownload=1&quot; # ) What can you do with the data in its existing form? What questions do you wish you could ask about these songs, artists, and the places they come from? 12.2 working with geodata: a function to get US states from latitude/longitude When I first ran this code in 2018, the variables included states and countries. The current dataset doesn’t have these, but it does have longitude and latitude. To get state data from this, reverse geocoding is needed. A Google search turned up the following function. Note that it requires two additional libraries, ‘maps’ and ‘maptools.’ # source is https://github.com/abresler # The single argument to this function, pointsDF, is a data.frame in which: # - column 1 contains the longitude in degrees (negative in the US) # - column 2 contains the latitude in degrees latlong2state &lt;- function(pointsDF) { # Prepare SpatialPolygons object with one SpatialPolygon # per state (plus DC, minus HI &amp; AK) states &lt;- map(&#39;state&#39;, fill=TRUE, col=&quot;transparent&quot;, plot=FALSE) IDs &lt;- sapply(strsplit(states$names, &quot;:&quot;), function(x) x[1]) states_sp &lt;- map2SpatialPolygons(states, IDs=IDs, proj4string=CRS(&quot;+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84&quot;)) # Convert pointsDF to a SpatialPoints object pointsSP &lt;- SpatialPoints(pointsDF, proj4string=CRS(&quot;+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84&quot;)) # Use &#39;over&#39; to get _indices_ of the Polygons object containing each point indices &lt;- over(pointsSP, states_sp) # Return the state names of the Polygons object containing each point stateNames &lt;- sapply(states_sp@polygons, function(x) x@ID) stateNames[indices] } 12.2.1 applying the function to the music data If you have run the chunk above, the latlong2state function will now exists in your environment. You still need to apply the function to your data. We do this using three of the essential tools in the munger’s toolbox: select (to choose several columns from the data), mutate (to create a new variable), and finally drop_na (to drop cases with missing data - here, artists from outside of the US). # create a new dataset with just latitude and longitude tempLatLong &lt;- music1 %&gt;% select (artist.longitude, artist.latitude) USartists &lt;- music1 %&gt;% mutate(state = latlong2state(tempLatLong)) %&gt;% drop_na(state) rm(tempLatLong) 12.3 drowning in the sea of songs (with apologies to ARIVOIM1187B990643) At this point, we have a list of songs and artists and some measures of “hotttness,” restricted to US artists and now including states as well as latitude and longitude. There is a field called song-id, but it doesn’t have song titles. (several hours later) I found the titles on the ’net. They were part of a file “millionsongsubset,” which is an archive of many files, and which is altogether about 2 GB in size. Within this, there is a file that looks right - let’s try it. The file is delimited by the characters “&lt;SEP&gt;”, but read_delim requires that data fields be separated by a single character (like a comma or a tab). So the file is read as a single variable, which R assigns the default name “X1”. I use mutate to replace each \"&lt;SEP&gt;\" by a tab, then the separate command to split X1 up into its constituent variables - the first is a mysterious ID, the second looks like the song.id in the original file, the third is an artist name, and the fourth is a song title. 12.3.1 combining the song titles with our US artists Finally, we can join this to the USartist data, as each row of the two files have a common key (song.id). We use a right_join - implicitly, “maybeTitles”, which is at the head of the pipe, is on the left. The right_join will link the left (maybeTitles) file with the right (USartists), by what appears to be a common key: maybeTitles &lt;- read_delim(&quot;subset_unique_tracks.txt&quot;,&quot;~&quot;, col_names = FALSE) %&gt;% mutate(X1 = str_replace_all(X1, &quot;&lt;SEP&gt;&quot;, &quot;\\t&quot;)) %&gt;% separate(X1, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;, into = c(&quot;ID1&quot;, &quot;song.id&quot;, &quot;artistFromMaybeTitles&quot;, &quot;SongTitle&quot;)) %&gt;% right_join(USartists, key = &quot;song.id&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## X1 = col_character() ## ) ## Joining, by = &quot;song.id&quot; So far, so good. Do things line up correctly? If the match is perfect, the two artist fields should be identical. We can use the [not] oddly-titled logical function “identical” to check this: identical(maybeTitles$artistFromMaybeTitles, maybeTitles$artist.name) ## [1] FALSE Whoops. The two variables aren’t the same - or are they? Run the following commands, which includes two more of the essential munging tools - select and arrange. Here, note that the “filter” function is used to select cases where the two variables are different. maybeTitles %&gt;% filter (artistFromMaybeTitles != artist.name) %&gt;% select (artistFromMaybeTitles, artist.name) %&gt;% arrange(artistFromMaybeTitles) %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## artistFromMaybeTitles artist.name ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Alvin Youngblood Hart Alvin YoungbloodA Hart ## 2 Andraé Crouch &amp; Solid Gospel AndraA(c) Crouch &amp; Solid Gospel ## 3 Angélica María AngA(c)lica MarAa ## 4 Fabián FabiA!n ## 5 Ill Niño Ill NiA+-o ## 6 Los Muñequitos De Matanzas Los MuA+-equitos De Matanzas 12.3.2 exercises What happened with the artist names? How would you move forward with these data? Do something interesting with the data - use filter, arrange, and select in your piped code. Work with the babynames data. Use mutate to create an interesting new variable. most importantly, make progress on your class project. You will be presenting this two weeks from today. 12.4 review of munging tools The primary tools, at least in my experience, are these: If you want to pull out only certain columns, use select. If you want to pull out only certain rows, use filter. If you want to sort, you arrange. If you want to create, you mutate. If you have two datasets with a common key (an identifier), you join. 12.4.1 and still more munging We’ve also used separate to split a column into several; the complement of this is unite. You may want to add new measures for all cases without a common key. Here, you can use the bind_cols function. If you instead want to add observations to an existing dataframe, you may bind_rows. We haven’t yet considered the tools used to reshape data frames from short-and-wide to long-and-narrow, and vice-versa. In our music data, we might, for example, want to think about the data by artist (with possibly multiple songs on each line), or song-titles (with possibly covers by different artists on each line). More typically, consider repeated-measures data in which each score reflects a measure taken on one of ten subjects and one of three occasions - for example, scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) before, during, and after treatment. Here, we may wish to structure the data in a “long” format with thirty rows (one for each subject X occasion) and three columns (person, occasion, and BDI), or in a “wide” format with just ten rows (one for each subject), and four columns (person, BDI-before, etc). To move from “long” to “wide,” use the spread command, and to move instead from “wide” to “long,” use gather. "],
["an-interlude.html", "13 an interlude 13.1 global data 13.2 Florida data 13.3 network models 13.4 back to R: relational data", " 13 an interlude Over the last few weeks of the class, we have spent an increasing amount of time discussing the coronavirus and its growth into what is now a pandemic (a global epidemic). For over a month now, we’ve studied and plotted global trends in the data; in the last week, classes have been moved online as an attempt to increase social distancing and to do our part to slow the growth of the network. Here, I bring together a few of the things that we have discussed 13.1 global data My R code for examining the global data is available on Github. That code illustrates some of the challenges in working with an emerging dataset, including the changing formats for dates and times talked about in chapter 14. As of a few days ago, unfortunately, the data have been problematic. Still, there are neat representations of the global data, including maps from ArcGIS and interactive tools, some of which use the R “shiny” package; you can find the code for one of these here. Data scientists all over the world are looking at this (and because of this any new tools that we might create will likely duplicate the work of others), but there are still questions about the data that are worth asking rigorously, for example, is the US really two weeks behind Italy? 13.2 Florida data In the last 48 hours, the Florida department of health has moved to a sophisticated county-by-county map of infection rates. One thing to consider about this map, as well as maps of the USA and world, is that they don’t adjust for population density. Is the proportion of infected cases greater in Florida than, say, in Massachusetts? How would you find this, examine it, plot it, and what would it tell you? By the way, we talked about how we can use the wayback machine to look at historical changes in a website . You can use this not just to recover changes in a dataset, but also uncover neat things such as the first honors college web page. 13.3 network models There are many news stories focused on how to constrain the spread of the virus, and whether it is worthwhile to restrict individual freedom (quarantines, closed borders) and invade individual privacy (use cell-phone tracking data to examine the histories of persons discovered to have been infected). I think that our answers to these questions should depend not just on these values (and how we value an individual life), but also on models - what happens if we (try to) keep people away from each other? These can be understood as questions about networks, and how networks change over time when various parameters are changed. Agent-based models using simple tools such as NetLogo examine such phenomena as contagion change under various conditions, and they are fun to play around with. I encourage you to explore them, and to consider some of the built in games, such as the spread of disease model. Can you generate results consistent with the “flatten the curve” idea? 13.4 back to R: relational data There are two sources which I will refer you to for now. The first is chapter 13 of R4DS. The second is what Jenny Bryan describes as a cheatsheet, but is I think more than this (https://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html). This shows how the various “joins” of dplyr work in combining two tibbles (superheroes and publishers). If you want to get a feel for how combining data works, it is a great start. "],
["strings-factors-dates-and-times.html", "14 strings, factors, dates, and times 14.1 strings 14.2 factors 14.3 dates 14.4 times", " 14 strings, factors, dates, and times This chapter discusses some of the types of data other than numeric and logical, in particular strings, factors, and dates/times. In this chapter, as in the last few, I refer primarily to three of the chapters in R4DS. Consider these notes supplementary. 14.1 strings Strings are sets of characters which may include “123” as well as “why *DID* the chicken cross the road?” Samples of text, from names to novels, are the most interesting type of string. Among the tools that are used in examining texts are searches (do these tweets include language associated with hate speech?), validity checks (does the string correspond to a valid zip code?), and reformatting (to lower case so that BOB, Bob, and bob are all coded as identical). These ideas are simple, but quickly become challenging when, for example, the strings in which we are interested include characters that R usually interprets as code - such as commas, quotes, and slashes. See the section on string basics (14.2) for how to “escape” these characters, for example, how to treat a hashtag (#) as just a character as opposed to the beginning of a comment. These rules are codified as regular expressions (regex, sometimes regexp). Regex are not unique to R, but are shared with other languages as well. In R, particularly in the tidyverse package, regex are typically implicit, represented within commands that are part of the stringr package and that typically begin with str_. For example, str_detect returns a set of logical values: library(tidyverse) donuts &lt;- c(&quot;glazed&quot;, &quot;cakes&quot;, &quot;Pink sprinkled&quot;, &quot;cream filled&quot;, &quot;day-old frosted&quot;, &quot;chocolates&quot;) donuts %&gt;% str_detect(&quot; &quot;) ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE Most of the str_ functions are straightforward, but remember that str_sub provides a subset, not a substitution; to change a string, use str_replace. As Hadley points out in R4DS, the autocomplete function in R_studio is very handy for helping you explore the different functions - in your console, type str_ … then scroll through the possibilities. donuts %&gt;% str_sub(1,5) ## [1] &quot;glaze&quot; &quot;cakes&quot; &quot;Pink &quot; &quot;cream&quot; &quot;day-o&quot; &quot;choco&quot; donuts %&gt;% str_replace(&quot; &quot;,&quot;_&quot;) ## [1] &quot;glazed&quot; &quot;cakes&quot; &quot;Pink_sprinkled&quot; &quot;cream_filled&quot; ## [5] &quot;day-old_frosted&quot; &quot;chocolates&quot; As you work with texts, simple problems sometimes require sophisticated codes. The regex that are used to solve these problems quickly become dense and challenging. One tool that can help you is the str_view command, which returns (when used in R studio) highlighted text showing corresponding passages. For example: dumbSlashMovieTitles &lt;- c(&quot;Craslash&quot;, &quot;Revenge o&#39; \\&#39;McSlashy&#39;&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Episode \\\\slash&quot;) dumbSlashMovieTitles %&gt;% str_view (&quot;sh&quot;) Note the effects of the backslash: For example, the Star Wars movie has two slashes in the input, but only one in the output, as the backslash is the escape character that tells R to take the next character literally (as in the ‘Revenge’ movie). So. How would you use str_view to find strings which include the backslash character in our dumbSlashMovieTitles? [Experiment. Google. Ask your classmates.] The density of regex statements can make them challenging. The backslash case is an unusual one, but other special characters are more common, and can be useful, including (for example) indicators for the beginning (^) or end ($) of a string: # get rid of suspected plural donuts %&gt;% str_replace (&quot;s$&quot;, &quot;&quot;) ## [1] &quot;glazed&quot; &quot;cake&quot; &quot;Pink sprinkled&quot; &quot;cream filled&quot; ## [5] &quot;day-old frosted&quot; &quot;chocolate&quot; A particularly useful function in stringr is str_split, which can be used to quickly break a text into discrete words. Note that using a space and the explicit “word” boundary give different results. str_split(donuts, &quot; &quot;, simplify = TRUE) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;glazed&quot; &quot;&quot; ## [2,] &quot;cakes&quot; &quot;&quot; ## [3,] &quot;Pink&quot; &quot;sprinkled&quot; ## [4,] &quot;cream&quot; &quot;filled&quot; ## [5,] &quot;day-old&quot; &quot;frosted&quot; ## [6,] &quot;chocolates&quot; &quot;&quot; str_split(donuts, boundary (&quot;word&quot;), simplify = TRUE) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] &quot;glazed&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; ## [2,] &quot;cakes&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; ## [3,] &quot;Pink&quot; &quot;sprinkled&quot; &quot;&quot; ## [4,] &quot;cream&quot; &quot;filled&quot; &quot;&quot; ## [5,] &quot;day&quot; &quot;old&quot; &quot;frosted&quot; ## [6,] &quot;chocolates&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; The output of str_split is generally a list (more on that soon), but here the lists are simplified into tibbles. In the tidyverse, str_split is typically one of the first steps in preparing text. The tidytext package (https://www.tidytextmining.com/), which is discussed at length in the computational social science course, builds on this foundation and is a powerful set of tools for all sorts of problems in formal text analysis. 14.2 factors Conditions (experimental vs control), categories (male or female), types (scorpio, “hates astrology”) and other nominal measures are categorical variables or factors. In the tidyverse, the r package for dealing with this type of measure is forcats, one of the core parts of the tidyverse. Here’s an example of a categorical variable. Why is it set up like this, and what does it do? # Example of a factor eyes &lt;- factor(x = c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;zombieRed&quot;), levels = c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;green&quot;)) eyes ## [1] blue green green &lt;NA&gt; ## Levels: blue brown green In base R, string variables (“donut”, “anti-Brexit”, and “yellow”) are generally treated as factors by default. In the tidyverse, string variables are treated as strings until they are explicitly declared as factors. The syntax for working with factors-as-categories is given in Chapter 15 of R4DS. I will not duplicate that here, but I will point out that factors are represented internally in R as numbers, and converting (coercing) factors to other data types can occasionally lead to nasty surprises. Sections 15.4 and 15.5 describe how factors can be cleanly reordered and modified. 14.2.1 types of babies In the babynames data, baby’s gender is a categorical variable, which is treated (because tidyverse) as a character or string. Here, we make it into a factor. We create two other factors as well. library(tidyverse) library(babynames) # adding third level for non-binary babies sexlevels &lt;- c(&quot;M&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;O&quot;) babynames2 &lt;- babynames %&gt;% mutate(sex = factor(sex, levels = sexlevels)) %&gt;% mutate(beginVowel = case_when( substr(name,1,1) %in% c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;E&quot;,&quot;I&quot;,&quot;O&quot;,&quot;U&quot;) ~ &quot;Vowel&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;Consonant&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(beginVowel = factor(beginVowel)) %&gt;% mutate (century = case_when( year &lt; 1900 ~ &quot;19th&quot;, year &lt; 2000 ~ &quot;20th&quot;, year &gt; 1999 ~ &quot;21st&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(century = factor(century)) Use the syntax above to create types of names for different generations (boomers, gen x, Millenials, gen z). Use https://www.kasasa.com/articles/generations/gen-x-gen-y-gen-z to determine your groupings. Say something interesting about the data - names, genders, etc. Plot this. 14.2.2 types of grown-ups If you would instead like to examine survey data, the forcats package includes a set of categorical variables. Using the discussion in Chapter 15 of R4DS as your guide, examine the relationship between two or more of these categorical variables. Again, plot these gss_cat ## # A tibble: 21,483 x 9 ## year marital age race rincome partyid relig denom tvhours ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 2000 Never ma~ 26 White $8000 to ~ Ind,near r~ Protesta~ Souther~ 12 ## 2 2000 Divorced 48 White $8000 to ~ Not str re~ Protesta~ Baptist~ NA ## 3 2000 Widowed 67 White Not appli~ Independent Protesta~ No deno~ 2 ## 4 2000 Never ma~ 39 White Not appli~ Ind,near r~ Orthodox~ Not app~ 4 ## 5 2000 Divorced 25 White Not appli~ Not str de~ None Not app~ 1 ## 6 2000 Married 25 White $20000 - ~ Strong dem~ Protesta~ Souther~ NA ## 7 2000 Never ma~ 36 White $25000 or~ Not str re~ Christian Not app~ 3 ## 8 2000 Divorced 44 White $7000 to ~ Ind,near d~ Protesta~ Luthera~ NA ## 9 2000 Married 44 White $25000 or~ Not str de~ Protesta~ Other 0 ## 10 2000 Married 47 White $25000 or~ Strong rep~ Protesta~ Souther~ 3 ## # ... with 21,473 more rows 14.3 dates The challenges of combining time-demarcated data (Chapter 16) are significant. For dates, a variety of different formats (3-April, October 23, 1943, 10/12/92) must be made sense of. Sometimes we are concerned with durations (how many days, etc.); on other occasions, we are concerned with characteristics of particular dates (as in figuring out the day of the week on which you were born). And don’t forget about leap years. In R, the lubridate package (a non-core part of the tidyverse, i.e., one that you must load separately) helps to handle dates and times smoothly. It anticipates many of the problems we might encounter in extracting date and time information from strings. Lubridate generally works well to simplify files with dates and times, and can be used to help in data munging. For example, in my analyses of the Corona data, dates and times were reported in four different ways. The code below decodes these transparently and combines them into a common date/time format . 2/3/20 6 PM 2/3/20 18:00 2/3/20 18:00:00 2020-02-03 18:00:00 # not run coronaData2 &lt;- coronaData %&gt;% mutate (`FixedDate = parse_date_time(`Last Update`, c(&#39;mdy hp&#39;,&#39;mdy HM&#39;, &#39;mdy HMS&#39;,&#39;ymd HMS&#39;))) 14.4 times Working with temporal data is often challenging. The existence of, for example, 12 versus 24 hour clocks, time zones, and daylight savings, can make a simple question about duration quite challenging. Imagine that Fred was born in Singapore at the exact moment of Y2K. He now lives in NYC. How many hours has he been alive as of right now? How would you solve this? # find timezones for Singapore and NYC # a = get datetime for Y2K in Singapore in UTC # b = get datetime for now in NYC in UTC # compute difference and express in sensible metric "],
["lists.html", "15 lists", " 15 lists Up until now, we have we have thought about ‘data structures’ as matrices (rectangles, two-dimensional arrays), in which columns correspond to variables and rows to observations, and in which each variable has a particular type, such as numeric or character (or, in the last chapter, special types such as factors and dates/times). In base R, data matrices are typically represented as data frames (type = df). In the Tidyverse, we have been using a special type of data frame, the tibble (type = df and tbl_df). The diamonds dataset, for example, is a tibble: library(tidyverse) library(babynames) babynames2 &lt;- babynames %&gt;% mutate(generation = case_when( (1944 &lt;= year) &amp; (year &lt;= 1964) ~ &quot;boomer&quot;, (1965 &lt;= year) &amp; (year &lt;= 1979) ~ &quot;genX&quot;, (1980 &lt;= year) &amp; (year &lt;= 1994) ~ &quot;millenial&quot;, (1995 &lt;= year) &amp; (year &lt;= 2019) ~ &quot;genZ&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(generation = factor(generation)) str(babynames2$generation) ## Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;boomer&quot;,&quot;genX&quot;,..: NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ... library(magrittr) babynames3 &lt;- babynames2 %&gt;% # count(generation) %&gt;% na.omit(generation) Within the diamonds tibble, we can examine the types of each variable. This uses the sapply function to SIMPLY APPLY a function (class) to the columns of a data frame or tibble. Here, each column (such as $carat) is a vector, and each vector is homogeneous (of one particular type): diamonds %&gt;% sapply(class) ## $carat ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## ## $cut ## [1] &quot;ordered&quot; &quot;factor&quot; ## ## $color ## [1] &quot;ordered&quot; &quot;factor&quot; ## ## $clarity ## [1] &quot;ordered&quot; &quot;factor&quot; ## ## $depth ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## ## $table ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## ## $price ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; ## ## $x ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## ## $y ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## ## $z ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Beyond these atomic vectors, data can take more complex forms, such as hierarchical or tree-like structures such as the following.

They describe the structure of the webpage you are looking at (which you can see, depending upon your browser, by clicking on something like ‘developer tools’). Data formats for representing nested structures include XML (Extensible Markup Language) and JSON (Java Script Object Notation). Many datasets of interest, such as this set of ratings of 10,000 books on Goodreads are structured as XML as well. In R, XML and JSON files will (after some likely massaging), be represented as lists. Lists are recursive, that is, they may include other lists. In addition to external data sources, the results of many procedures within R may also be represented as lists. Consider the following code. What does it do? What is in ‘mod’? Why is it stored like this? mod &lt;- lm(price ~ carat, data = diamonds) In R studio, you can inspect the structure of the list by clicking on it in the global environment window, by using the View tab, or with the command str(mod). You can extract rows of your list by including them in single brackets (which will return another list), or double brackets (which will return a vector or data frame). Compare the structure of the following data sets: b1 &lt;- mod[&#39;coefficients&#39;] b2 &lt;- mod[[&#39;coefficients&#39;]] c1 &lt;- mod[&#39;model&#39;] c2 &lt;- mod[[&#39;model&#39;]] Lists are, in a sense, containers (see the example of the pepper shakers in Chapter 20). The single bracket gives us the wrapper as well as what is inside; the double bracket extracts only the inner element. Lists can be challenging, but they are necessary in a world where data is complexly structured. The R package purrr, a core part of the tidyverse, includes functions which simplify working with lists; to learn more, there is a tutorial here. "],
["loops-functions-and-beyond.html", "16 loops, functions, and beyond 16.1 loops 16.2 from loop to apply to purrr::map 16.3 some examples of functions 16.4 how many bottles of what?", " 16 loops, functions, and beyond In one of the most important contemporary theoretical models of intelligence, (Sternberg 1999) has argued that the ability to automatize, that is, to work efficiently on repeated or habitual tasks, is a key component of intelligent behavior. Solving habitual problems efficiently - whether it is making a cup of coffee, honing to the shortest path to compete a shopping list in a supermarket or finish a series of errands across town - allows us to focus our limited resources on other challenging tasks. In programming, loops and functions are essential tools for making repetitive tasks simple. Simplifying your code is one of the more intellectually satisfying aspects of working in R or in any programming language. In R, loops are supplemented by additional tools for simplifying and avoiding repetition in code, including the ‘apply’ family and the map function in purrr. Functions (and, beyond this, custom libraries) can further streamline your work. 16.1 loops Consider the task of printing out a series of numbers. Here’s a simple example of how this could be done in a loop in R. It prints numbers between 1995 and 1998 (inclusive). knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE) library(kableExtra) library(tidyverse) library(babynames) for (i in 1995:1998) { # i is an index code print(i) # print the ith value in the sequence } # go to the next one until the range is complete ## [1] 1995 ## [1] 1996 ## [1] 1997 ## [1] 1998 Let’s expand on this a little, connecting back to the babynames data. This will print counts of the number of babies for each year in GenerationZ, which includes years from 1995-2015. genZ &lt;- (1995:2015) # this reduces the (big) babynames to a simple file of years and counts babyCounts &lt;- babynames %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% filter(year %in% genZ) %&gt;% summarize(nbabies = sum(n)) # and this uses a for loop to print each row in turn for (i in (1:nrow(babyCounts))) { # filename[i,j] == ith row and jth column print(paste((babyCounts[i,1]), babyCounts[i,2])) } ## [1] &quot;1995 3661351&quot; ## [1] &quot;1996 3646362&quot; ## [1] &quot;1997 3624799&quot; ## [1] &quot;1998 3677107&quot; ## [1] &quot;1999 3692537&quot; ## [1] &quot;2000 3778079&quot; ## [1] &quot;2001 3741451&quot; ## [1] &quot;2002 3736042&quot; ## [1] &quot;2003 3799971&quot; ## [1] &quot;2004 3818361&quot; ## [1] &quot;2005 3842004&quot; ## [1] &quot;2006 3952932&quot; ## [1] &quot;2007 3994007&quot; ## [1] &quot;2008 3926358&quot; ## [1] &quot;2009 3815638&quot; ## [1] &quot;2010 3690700&quot; ## [1] &quot;2011 3651914&quot; ## [1] &quot;2012 3650462&quot; ## [1] &quot;2013 3637310&quot; ## [1] &quot;2014 3696311&quot; ## [1] &quot;2015 3688687&quot; The syntax of loops, including where to put parentheses in index statements, can be tricky. Expect to refer to Google and StackExchange often in order to get your code running. Another good source is Chapter 21 of R4DS. There, Wickham goes in to additional detail, including a description of seq_along(df) as a tool for creating an index corresponding to 1:ncol(df). Here’s an example with the diamonds dataset: diamonds2 &lt;- diamonds %&gt;% select_if(., is.numeric) # for (i in (1:ncol(diamonds2))) { for (i in seq_along(diamonds2)) { print(paste(names(diamonds2[i]), round(mean(diamonds2[[i]]),2))) } ## [1] &quot;carat 0.8&quot; ## [1] &quot;depth 61.75&quot; ## [1] &quot;table 57.46&quot; ## [1] &quot;price 3932.8&quot; ## [1] &quot;x 5.73&quot; ## [1] &quot;y 5.73&quot; ## [1] &quot;z 3.54&quot; Chapter 21 of R4DS also considers some extensions to related problems such as loops of indefinite length, which can often be addressed using the ‘while’ command. 16.2 from loop to apply to purrr::map Understanding for loops is fundamental in programming, but in R they should often be sidestepped. If the order of iteration isn’t important (if, for example, it doesn’t matter which of the diamonds variables we take the mean of first), then using one of the measures from the apply family can generally be used to make your code simpler and more efficient. The logic is that one takes a dataframe (df or tibble), then applies a function to its rows or columns: # apply the function (mean) to the columns(2) of the df diamonds2 %&gt;% apply(2,mean) ## carat depth table price x y ## 0.7979397 61.7494049 57.4571839 3932.7997219 5.7311572 5.7345260 ## z ## 3.5387338 # simply apply - guesses that you are looking for col. means diamonds2 %&gt;% sapply(mean) ## carat depth table price x y ## 0.7979397 61.7494049 57.4571839 3932.7997219 5.7311572 5.7345260 ## z ## 3.5387338 The many variants of the apply family, including lapply [list apply] and tapply [table apply] as well as sapply, each have their own uses and can be quite efficient but, again, can be syntactically challenging. In the evolving tidyverse, the map family of commands is supplementing if not supplanting apply; these commands (part of the purrr package in the core tidyverse) may prove to be more convenient and clear. For example, the map_df function will apply a function and return a dataframe (tibble), which can be handy for further analysis. b &lt;-diamonds2 %&gt;% map_df(mean) b ## # A tibble: 1 x 7 ## carat depth table price x y z ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.798 61.7 57.5 3933. 5.73 5.73 3.54 16.3 some examples of functions If you repeat a series of lines of code several times in your program, it is often best to wrap this into a function. The first example is from a preregistered study I recently started of language and politics. For the preregistration, I ran analyses using simulated data, both to increase the likelihood that the code will run without error on real data and to help anticipate the analyses which are to be run on ‘real’ data. I began by getting a real body of text from the net and scrambling it, then constructing fake ‘Republican’ and ‘Democratic’ texts from this. Here, I illustrate this by constructing 50 sample documents, each consisting of between 5 and 20 words. The project is given in four steps: 16.3.1 preliminaries Here is the preliminary stuff, where I pull the data off the net and initialize the variables library(tidyverse) sampledata &lt;- read_csv(url( &quot;https://www.crowdflower.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sentiment-words-DFE-785960.csv&quot;)) # pulls off four words sampledata &lt;- sampledata[22:25] %&gt;% na.omit() ndocs &lt;- 50 minDocLength &lt;- 5 maxDocLength &lt;- 20 doc &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;character&quot;, length = ndocs) 16.3.2 the function Here’s the simple function which pulls a random word out of the matrix of sampledata. set.seed(33458) # a random seed is used to allow reproducible results getword &lt;- function() { rowid &lt;- sample(1:nrow(sampledata), 1) colid &lt;- sample(1:ncol(sampledata), 1) word &lt;- sampledata[rowid,colid] word } 16.3.3 applying the function The function is applied, first, to extract one word, then, in successive loops, to build up one phrase and then many. # combine words into docs # establish length of first phrase docLength &lt;- sample(minDocLength:maxDocLength,1) # initialize with one word sampleCorpus &lt;- getword() # loop to build up first phrase for (i in 1:docLength) { addWord &lt;- getword() sampleCorpus &lt;- paste(sampleCorpus, addWord) } #add additional simulated documents for (j in 2:ndocs) { docLength &lt;- sample(minDocLength:maxDocLength,1) newdoc &lt;- getword() for (i in 1:docLength - 1) { addWord &lt;- getword() newdoc &lt;- paste(newdoc, addWord) } sampleCorpus &lt;- rbind(newdoc,sampleCorpus) } Finally, the results are combined with a vector of alternating labels of ‘Dem’ and ‘Rep’: row.names(sampleCorpus) &lt;- NULL evenOdd &lt;- rep(c(&quot;Dem&quot;,&quot;Rep&quot;),length.out = nrow(sampleCorpus)) workingCorpus &lt;- as.tibble(cbind(evenOdd,sampleCorpus)) head(workingCorpus,5) ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## evenOdd V2 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Dem wild at heart nobody loves me lost art miss the sun need a doctor kin~ ## 2 Rep great player awfully nice back hurts not paying pretty rubbish found ~ ## 3 Dem yahooo make no promises horrible daughter ew crazy evening fit ## 4 Rep can&#39;t sleep lazy afternoon sucks #fedup great shame positive break fa~ ## 5 Dem problems nice funniest hurt not necessarily sad nose eat no problem d~ 16.4 how many bottles of what? To put the fun back into function, here’s a solution to the “99 bottles of beer” function described in r4DS 21.2.1. Study the code. Ask or answer a question about it in class or on Slack. beerSong &lt;- function(liquid = &quot;beer&quot;, count = 99, surface = &quot;wall&quot;) { songtext &lt;- &quot;&quot; for (i in (count:1)) { thisLine = (paste0(i, &quot; bottles of &quot;, liquid, &quot; on the &quot;, surface, &quot;, you take one down and pass it around,\\n&quot;)) songtext = c(songtext, thisLine) } songtext = c(songtext, (paste0(&quot;no more bottles of &quot;, liquid,&quot; on the &quot;, surface,&quot;...&quot;))) cat(songtext) # cat prints without line numbers } #beerSong() And here are solutions proposed by some of your classmates. How do they differ from each other, and from the solution given above? beersng &lt;- function(n) { if (n == 1) { cat(&quot;\\n&quot;,n,&quot; bottle of beer on the wall, &quot;,n, &quot; bottles of beer.\\nTake one down and pass it around,&quot;, &quot; no more bottles of beer on the wall.\\n&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;) cat(&quot;\\nNo more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.\\n&quot;, &quot;Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.\\n&quot;, sep=&quot;&quot;) } else { cat(&quot;\\n&quot;,n,&quot; bottles of beer on the wall, &quot;,n, &quot; bottles of beer.\\nTake one down and pass it around, &quot;, n-1, &quot; more bottles of beer on the wall.\\n&quot;, sep=&quot;&quot;) return(beersng(n-1)) } } #beersng(99) moreBeer &lt;- function () { for (i in 0:100){ starting_number &lt;- 100 if (starting_number - i == 0) { print(&quot;No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer, Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.&quot;) break } print(paste(starting_number - i, &quot;bottles of beer on the wall&quot;, &quot;Take one down and pass it around,&quot;, starting_number - i - 1, &quot;bottles of beer on the wall.&quot;)) } } # moreBeer() song &lt;- function(bottlesofbeer){ for(i in bottlesofbeer:1){ cat(bottlesofbeer,&quot; bottles of beer on the wall \\n&quot;, bottlesofbeer,&quot; bottles of beer \\nTake one down, pass it around \\n&quot;, bottlesofbeer-1, &quot; bottles of beer on the wall \\n&quot;,&quot; \\n&quot;) bottlesofbeer = bottlesofbeer - 1 } } #song(99) Which code is ‘best’? Good code is clear, but it is also efficient. We probably shouldn’t expect much in the way of differences between these functions in terms of speed (as each includes 99 iterations of a simple print command), but here’s a simple way to compare. Note that I’ve used the “sink” command to write my output to files rather than consoles: start_time &lt;- Sys.time() sink (file = &quot;f1.txt&quot;) beerSong(&quot;beer&quot;,99) sink() end_time &lt;- Sys.time() beerSongtime &lt;- end_time - start_time start_time &lt;- Sys.time() sink (file = &quot;f2.txt&quot;) beersng(99) sink() end_time &lt;- Sys.time() beersngtime &lt;- end_time - start_time start_time &lt;- Sys.time() sink (file = &quot;f3.txt&quot;) song(99) sink() end_time &lt;- Sys.time() songtime &lt;- end_time - start_time start_time &lt;- Sys.time() sink (file = &quot;f4.txt&quot;) moreBeer() sink() end_time &lt;- Sys.time() moreBeertime &lt;- end_time - start_time Here is the first line of output from each function, together with table showing the elapsed times: readLines(&quot;f1.txt&quot;,1) ## character(0) readLines(&quot;f2.txt&quot;,2) ## character(0) readLines(&quot;f3.txt&quot;,4) ## character(0) readLines(&quot;f4.txt&quot;,1) ## character(0) tibble(functionName = c(&quot;beerSongtime&quot;, &quot;beersngtime&quot;, &quot;songtime&quot;, &quot;moreBeertime&quot;), time = c(beerSongtime,beersngtime, songtime, moreBeertime)) %&gt;% kable(digits = 2) functionName time beerSongtime 0.02 secs beersngtime 0.02 secs songtime 0.04 secs moreBeertime 0.04 secs references "],

At the beginning of Chapter 23, he points out that The goal of a model is to provide a simple low-dimensional summary of a dataset. In the remainder of his section on modeling (Chapters 23 - 25), he presents an innovative approach to introducing models. Feel free to explore these. Our treatment, however, will deviate from this. 17.1 correlation (This section is excerpted directly from From https://github.com/datasciencelabs) Francis Galton, a polymath and cousin of Charles Darwin was interested, among other things, in how well can we predict a son’s height based on the parents’ heights. We have access to Galton’s family height data through the HistData package. We will create a dataset with the heights of fathers and the first son of each family. Here are the key summary statistics for the two variables of father and son height taken alone: library(HistData) data(&quot;GaltonFamilies&quot;) galton_heights &lt;- GaltonFamilies %&gt;% filter(childNum == 1 &amp; gender == &quot;male&quot;) %&gt;% select(father, childHeight) %&gt;% rename(son = childHeight) galton_heights %&gt;% summarize(mean(father), sd(father), mean(son), sd(son)) ## mean(father) sd(father) mean(son) sd(son) ## 1 69.09888 2.546555 70.45475 2.557061 This univariate description fails to capture the key characteristic of the data, namely, the idea that there is a relationship between the two variables: galton_heights %&gt;% ggplot(aes(father, son)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) Figure 17.1: Heights of father and son pairs plotted against each other. The correlation summarizes this relationship. In these data, the correlation (r) is about .50. galton_heights %&gt;% summarize(cor(father, son)) ## cor(father, son) ## 1 0.5007248 Incidentally, correlations based on small samples can bounce around quite a bit. Consider what happens when, for example, we sample just 25 cases from Galton’s data, then repeat this in a Monte Carlo analysis 1000 times to see the distribution of these sample rs: B &lt;- 1000 N &lt;- 25 R &lt;- replicate(B, { sample_n(galton_heights, N, replace = TRUE) %&gt;% # sample with replacement here summarize(r=cor(father, son)) %&gt;% .$r }) data.frame(R) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(R)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, color = &quot;grey&quot;) 17.1.1 The regression line If we are predicting a random variable \\(Y\\) knowing the value of another \\(X=x\\) using a regression line, then we predict that for every standard deviation, \\(\\sigma_X\\), that \\(x\\) increases above the average \\(mu_X\\), \\(Y\\) increases \\(\\rho\\) standard deviations \\(\\sigma_Y\\) above the average \\(\\mu_Y\\), where \\(\\rho\\) is the correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). To manually add a regression line to a plots, we will need the means and standard deviations of each variable together with their correlation: mu_x &lt;- mean(galton_heights$father) mu_y &lt;- mean(galton_heights$son) s_x &lt;- sd(galton_heights$father) s_y &lt;- sd(galton_heights$son) r &lt;- cor(galton_heights$father, galton_heights$son) m &lt;- r * s_y / s_x b &lt;- mu_y - m*mu_x galton_heights %&gt;% ggplot(aes(father, son)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + geom_abline(intercept = b, slope = m ) If we first standardize the variables, then the regression line has intercept 0 and slope equal to the correlation \\(\\rho\\). Here, the slope, regression line, and correlation are all equal (I’ve made the plot square to better indicate this). galton_heights %&gt;% ggplot(aes(scale(father), scale(son))) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = r) 17.1.2 Warning: there are two regression lines In general, when describing bivariate relationships, we talk of predicting y from x. But what if we want to reverse this? Here, for example, what if we want to predict the father’s height based on the son’s? For this, the intercept and slope of the lines will differ # son from father m_1 &lt;- r * s_y / s_x b_1 &lt;- mu_y - m_1*mu_x # vice-versa m_2 &lt;- r * s_x / s_y b_2 &lt;- mu_x - m_2*mu_y We will still see regression to the mean (the prediction for the father is closer to the father average than the son heights \\(y\\) is to the son average). Here is a plot showing the two regression lines, with blue for the predicting son heights with father heights and red for predicting father heights with son heights. galton_heights %&gt;% ggplot(aes(father, son)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + geom_abline(intercept = b_1, slope = m_1, col = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_abline(intercept = -b_2/m_2, slope = 1/m_2, col = &quot;red&quot;) 17.2 multiple regression We extend regression (predicting one continuous variable from another) to the multivariate case (predicting one variable from many). We extend this logic to the cases where our variables are not normally distributed, as in the case of dichotomous variables (yes/no, true/false), as well as counts, which often are skewed.

Here’s a scatterplot matrix of the Swiss data. Look at the first column of plots (or first row of the correlations). What is the relationship between fertility and each of the other variables? ggpairs (swiss, lower = list( continuous = &quot;smooth&quot;), axisLabels =&quot;none&quot;, switch = &#39;both&#39;) Here, we predict fertility from all of the remaining variables together in a single regression analysis, using the lm (linear model) command. As we saw in Chapter 15, the result of this analysis is a list. We can pull out the key features of the data using the summary() command.

We’ll apply ggpairs here, but for clarity will show only half of the data at a time. The dependent variable of interest (nbaffairs) will be included in both plots: Fair1 &lt;- Fair %&gt;% select(sex:child, nbaffairs) ggpairs(Fair1, # if you wanted to jam all 9 vars onto one page you could do this # upper = list(continuous = wrap(ggally_cor, size = 10)), lower = list(continuous = &#39;smooth&#39;), axisLabels = &quot;none&quot;, switch = &#39;both&#39;) Fair2 &lt;- Fair %&gt;% select(religious:nbaffairs) ggpairs(Fair2, lower = list(continuous = &#39;smooth&#39;), axisLabels = &quot;none&quot;, switch = &#39;both&#39;) Exercise Study the data. Learn about the measures by looking at Fair in the help tab of R studio. What do the scatterplot matrices shown above tell us? Can you just run a regression on it as is? Try predicting nbaffairs from the remaining 8 variables in Fair (not Fair1 or Fair2), using the same syntax in the Swiss data. Does it work?
