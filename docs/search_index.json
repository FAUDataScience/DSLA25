Hochster’s view of data science arguably omits a critical component of the field. Data science is driven not just by statistics and computer science, but also by “domain expertise:” 1.1 Type C data science The iconic Venn diagram model of data science suggests what we can call a “Type C data science.” It begins with “domain expertise” in your concentration in the arts, humanities, social and/or natural sciences, it both informs and can be informed by new methods and tools of data analysis, and it includes such things as communication (including writing and the design and display of quantitative data), collaboration (making use of the tools of team science), and citizenship (serving the public good, overcoming the digital divide, furthering social justice, increasing public health, diminishing human suffering, and making the world a more beautiful place). It’s shaped, too, by an awareness of the creepiness of living increasingly in a measured, observed world. 1.2 The incompleteness of the Venn diagram The Venn diagram model is incomplete. In addition to statistics, computing/hacking, and domain expertise, a number of additional skills contribute to the success of the data scientist. These include collaboration, which is arguably the most distinctive feature of contemporary scholarship in the natural and social sciences as well as in the private sector (Isaacson 2014). Communication is central to data science because results are inconsequential unless they are recognized, understood, and built upon; facets of communication include oral presentations, written texts and, too, clear data visualizations. Reproducibility is related to both communication and collaboration. There has been something of a crisis in recent years in the social and natural sciences as many results initially characterized as “statistically significant” have been found not to replicate. The reasons for this are multiple and presently contentious, but one path towards better science includes the public sharing of methods and data, ideally before experiments are undertaken. Reproducible methods are a key feature of contemporary data science. Pragmatism refers to the relevance of work towards real-world goals. Ideally, these pragmatic concerns take into account ethical concerns as well. 1.3 The expertise dimension Cutting across these eight facets (statistics, computing, domain expertise, collaboration, communication, reproducibility, pragmatism, and ethics), a second dimension can be articulated. No one of us can excel in all eight domains, rather, we might aim towards goals ranging from literacy (can understand) through proficiency (can get by) to fluency (can practice) to leadership (can create new solutions or methods). That is, we can think of a continuum of knowledge, skills, interests, and goals, ranging from that which characterizes the data consumer to the data citizen to the data science contributor. A Type C data science includes this dimension as well. 1.4 Google and the liberal arts Data science is at its core empirical, and all of this rhetoric would be meaningless if not grounded in real world findings. Although it was recently reported that soft skills rather than STEM training were the most important predictors of success among Google employees, it’s difficult to know whether these results would generalize to a less select group. Nonetheless, there is a clear need for individuals with well-rounded training in the liberal arts in data science positions and, conversely, learning data science is arguably a key part of a contemporary liberal arts education. 1.5 Data sci and TMI It has been said (by whom?) that the biggest difference between traditional stats and data science is that the former is typically concerned with making inferences from datasets that are too small, while the latter is concerned with extracting a signal from data that is or are too big. The struggle to extract meaning from a sea of information - of finding needles in haystacks, of finding faint signals in a cacophany of overstimulation - is arguably the question of the age. It is a question we deal with as individuals on a moment-by-moment basis. It is a challenge I face as I wade through the many things that I could include in this class and these notes. The primacy of editing or selection lies at the essence of human perception and the creation of art forms ranging from novels to film. And it is a key challenge for the data scientist faces as well. 1.6 A challenge Imagine it is ten years from today. You are working in a cool job (yay). How, ideally, would ‘data science’ inform your professional contributions? More proximally (closer to today) - what are your own goals for progress in data science, in terms of the model described above? References "],

["pretest.html", "3 Pretest 3.1 A thought experiment", " 3 Pretest Reflect on your own knowledge of data science, including the necessary-but-not-sufficient areas of computer programming and statistics. You may know more than you think you do. Even if you haven’t had formal programming, you may well have experience with spreadsheets such as Excel or Google Sheets? What does ‘=SUM (A1:A15)’ mean? In a spreadsheet, if ‘=SUM (A1:A15)’ was in cell A16, and you copied this to cell B16, what would the result be? Statistics is, of course, relevant in a myriad of ways. Consider, for example, the prospects for Susie, a young woman who is applying to two Med schools. At School A, 25% of students are accepted, and at School B, 25% are accepted as well. You are Susie. Are you going to get in to at least one of these programs? What is the probability? Does your estimate depend upon any assumptions? 3.1 A thought experiment Would it be possible to assign grades in a class based not just on what students know at the end of the term, but also on how much they have learned? You could, in principle, do this using regression analysis. That is, you could predict final exam scores from pretest scores, and use the residuals - the extent to which students did better or worse than expected - as a contributor to final exam grades. Interestingly, there would be an unusual incentive for students on this ‘pretest’ to do, seemingly perversely, as poorly as possible. How might you address this? "],

["an-introduction-to-r.html", "5 An introduction to R", " 5 An introduction to R R is a system for reproducible science, and reproducibility is essential (Baumer et al. 2014). R is a system for Representing data in cool, insight-facilitating ways. R is really popular, and really growing. Learning R will make you a more attractive candidate for many graduate programs as well as jobs in the private sector. 5.0.1 One does not ‘learn R’ Unlike, say, learning to ride a bicycle, fry an egg, or drive a car with a manual transmission, learning R is not a discrete accomplishment that one masters and then moves on. Rather, R is an evolving, open system of applications and tools which is so vast that there is always more that one can achieve, new lessons that one can learn. 5.0.2 What R stands for Historically, R grew out of S which could stand for Statistics. But what does R stand for? R does not stand for ‘argh,’ although you may proclaim this in frustration (‘arggh, why can’t I get this to work?) or, perhaps, in satisfaction (’arggh, matey, that be a clever way of doing this’). R might stand for relatively high level. Programming languages can be described along a continuum from high to low level, the former (like R) are more accessible to humans, the latter (like assembly language) more accessible to machines. Python, Java, and C++ are all more towards the middle of this continuum. R stands, in part, for resources. There are many resources, including, for example - Online resources include the simple (and less simple) lessons of SwirlR, which offers the possibility of “learning R in R,” as well as DataCamp, the Data Science Certificate Program at Johns Hopkins, and other MOOCs. Books include Peng (2015) - which includes not only videos of his lectures in the program at Hopkins, but also a brief list of still more resources - and Wickham and Grolemund (2016). You’ll also learn (more directly) from people, including your classmates, as well as the broader community of people around the world. There are hundreds if not thousands of people, young and old, who are on the road with you. As I am, just a step or two (hopefully) ahead. 5.0.3 On R Studio and commercial vs. open software R Studio is a commercial enterprise whose business model, judged from afar, is an important one in the world of technology and open science. Most of what R Studio offers is free (97% according to Garrett Grolemund in the video below). The commercial product they offer makes sense for a relative few, but it is sufficiently lucrative to fund the enterprise. The free product helps to drive the popularity of R studio; this widespread use, in turn, makes it increasingly essential for businesses to use. This mixed free/premium model characterizes Slack as well, but while the ratio of free to paid users of Slack is on the order of 3:1, for R it is, I am guessing, an order of magnitude higher than this. The openness of R is an important feature, not just because it saves you money, but because contributing to the world of R is an act of digital democracy, for in contributing to the world of R we open up knowledge to others who may lack our privileges. The corporate clients of R studio, in essence, support the rest of us. 5.0.3.1 A digression and thought experiment All contemporary cars have computers. Many of these are quite sophisticated, allowing cars to drive themselves in increasingly autonomous ways. But the potential of autonomous cars will not be realized until they are connected on the ’net. Communication with other cars, stoplights, etc. will reduce travel times, increase fuel efficiency, and increase safety, too. Until, that is, they are hacked. Who should be the guardians of the net linking cars? Should this be closed (with Ford having it’s own safeguards), or public? 5.0.4 A few characteristics of R R includes the base plus thousands of packages. These packages are customized add-ons which simplify certain tasks, such as text analysis. But there are at least 40 different packages for this - where do you begin? The most recent answer, and where we will start, is the curated list of packages which jointly comprise the tidyverse (Wickham and Grolemund 2016). Peng (2015) speculated that “it would be straightforward to build an R package for ordering pizza.” Does one exist now? R is an object-oriented language. At an atomic level, these include characters, real numbers, integers, complex numbers, and logical. These atoms are combined into vectors, which (unless they are lists) include objects of the same type (Peng 2015). Missing values may be characterized by NA (not available) or NaN (not a number, implying an undefined or impossible value). Attributes of R include such things as name, dimensions (for vectors and arrays), class (that’s the atomic thing), length, etc. Vectors can be combined into a data frame (or, in a simplified form, a tibble), which greatly facilitates statistical analysis.

["empiricism-intuition.html", "7 Empiricism &gt; intuition 7.1 Health: Internet (search) data can illuminate medical syndromes 7.2 The NBA 7.3 Sex", " 7 Empiricism &gt; intuition Thoughts on the first four chapters of Stephens-Davidowitz (2017). Note that Italicized blocks are exact quotes pulled off Kindle 7.1 Health: Internet (search) data can illuminate medical syndromes 7.1.1 Pancreatic cancer Searching for back pain and then yellowing skin turned out to be a sign of pancreatic cancer; searching for just back pain alone made it unlikely someone had pancreatic cancer. Similarly, searching for indigestion and then abdominal pain was evidence of pancreatic cancer, while searching for just indigestion without abdominal pain meant a person was unlikely to have it. … a clear example of rigorous data science and computers teaching us things our gut alone could never find. This is also one case where the size of the dataset matters. Sometimes there is insufficient experience for our unaided gut to draw upon. It is unlikely that you—or your close friends or family members—have seen enough cases of pancreatic cancer to tease out the difference between indigestion followed by abdominal pain compared to indigestion alone. Intuition isn’t really the problem: For Stephens-Davidowitz, the problem is not “intuition,” or what Kahneman would refer to as Type I thinking, but “intuition based on limited data” 7.1.2 Depression Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a real thing. It’s evidenced in search data too. In winter months, warm climates, such as that of Honolulu, Hawaii, have 40 percent fewer depression searches than cold climates, such as that of Chicago, Illinois. Just how significant is this effect? An optimistic read of the effectiveness of antidepressants would find that the most effective drugs decrease the incidence of depression by only about 20 percent. To judge from the Google numbers, a Chicago-to-Honolulu move would be at least twice as effective as medication for your winter blues. 7.2 The NBA This is really clever in several ways. First, the question. As a social scientist, Stephens-Davidowitz (2017) addresses this empirically 7.2.1 Are you more likely to make it in the NBA if you grow up poor?** 7.2.1.1 An empirical approach This is arguably a little weak, in that it is indirect. It was suggested in a paper by two economists, Roland Fryer and Steven Levitt, that a black person’s first name is an indication of his socioeconomic background. Fryer and Levitt studied birth certificates in California in the 1980s and found that, among African-Americans, poor, uneducated, and single moms tend to give their kids different names than do middle-class, educated, and married parents…California-born NBA players were half as likely to have unique names as the average black male, a statistically significant difference. 7.2.1.2 Applying decision analysis : Looking at both types of ‘errors’ The miss (rough/no NBA): Let’s look at the story of Doug Wrenn, one of the most talented basketball prospects in the 1990s. His college coach, Jim Calhoun at the University of Connecticut, who has trained future NBA all-stars, claimed Wrenn jumped the highest of any man he had ever worked with. But Wrenn had a challenging upbringing. He was raised by a single mother in Blood Alley, one of the roughest neighborhoods in Seattle. In Connecticut, he consistently clashed with those around him. He would taunt players, question coaches, and wear loose-fitting clothes in violation of team rules. He also had legal troubles—he stole shoes from a store and snapped at police officers. Calhoun finally had enough and kicked him off the team. Wrenn got a second chance at the University of Washington. But there, too, an inability to get along with people derailed him. He fought with his coach over playing time and shot selection and was kicked off this team as well. Wrenn went undrafted by the NBA, bounced around lower leagues, moved in with his mother, and was eventually imprisoned for assault. “My career is over,” Wrenn told the Seattle Times in 2009. “My dreams, my aspirations are over. Doug Wrenn is dead. That basketball player, that dude is dead. It’s over.” Wrenn had the talent not just to be an NBA player, but to be a great, even a legendary player. But he never developed the temperament to even stay on a college team. The false positive (supportive/NBA): Perhaps if he’d had a stable early life, he could have been the next Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan, of course, also had an impressive vertical leap. Plus a large ego and intense competitiveness—a personality at times that was not unlike Wrenn’s. Jordan could be a difficult kid. At the age of twelve, he was kicked out of school for fighting. But he had at least one thing that Wrenn lacked: a stable, middle-class upbringing. His father was an equipment supervisor for General Electric, his mother a banker. And they helped him navigate his career. In fact, Jordan’s life is filled with stories of his family guiding him away from the traps that a great, competitive talent can fall into. After Jordan was kicked out of school, his mother responded by taking him with her to work. He was not allowed to leave the car and instead had to sit there in the parking lot reading books. After he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls, his parents and siblings took turns visiting him to make sure he avoided the temptations that come with fame and money. Jordan’s career did not end like Wrenn’s, with a little-read quote in the Seattle Times. It ended with a speech upon induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame that was watched by millions of people. In his speech, Jordan said he tried to stay “focused on the good things about life—you know how people perceive you, how you respect them . . . how you are perceived publicly. Take a pause and think about the things that you do. And that all came from my parents.” The data tells us Jordan is absolutely right to thank his middle-class, married parents. The data tells us that in worse-off families, in worse-off communities, there are NBA-level talents who are not in the NBA. These men had the genes, had the ambition, but never developed the temperament to become basketball superstars. And no—whatever we might intuit—being in circumstances so desperate that basketball seems “a matter of life or death” does not help. Stories like that of Doug Wrenn can help illustrate this. And data proves it. The hit (poor/NBA) In June 2013, LeBron James was interviewed on television after winning his second NBA championship. (He has since won a third.) “I’m LeBron James,” he announced. “From Akron, Ohio. From the inner city. I am not even supposed to be here.” Twitter and other social networks erupted with criticism. How could such a supremely gifted person, identified from an absurdly young age as the future of basketball, claim to be an underdog? In fact, anyone from a difficult environment, no matter his athletic prowess, has the odds stacked against him. James’s accomplishments, in other words, are even more exceptional than they appear to be at first. Data proves that, too. The correct rejection (privileged/no NBA) Stephens-Davidowitz (2017) is, perhaps, too polite to say this, but this would be me. :) 7.2.1.3 The power of brute force facts: The effect of height How much does height matter? NBA players sometimes fib a little about their height, and there is no listing of the complete height distribution of American males. But working with a rough mathematical estimate of what this distribution might look like and the NBA’s own numbers, it is easy to confirm that the effects of height are enormous—maybe even more than we might have suspected. I estimate that each additional inch roughly doubles your odds of making it to the NBA. And this is true throughout the height distribution. A 5’11” man has twice the odds of reaching the NBA as a 5’10” man. A 6’11” man has twice the odds of reaching the NBA as a 6’10” man. It appears that, among men less than six feet tall, only about one in two million reach the NBA. Among those over seven feet tall, I and others have estimated, something like one in five reach the NBA. 7.3 Sex New methods of analysis can help examine hypotheses regarding, for example, psychoanalysis. Note the cleverness of the methods here as well as the results. 7.3.1 Dreams, misspellings, and Freudian slips Freud argued that all behavior is meaningful and can help reveal the nature of the mind. Dreams, misrememberings, misspellings, and so forth are not random, but reveal the presence of (sexualized) unconscious motives. 7.3.2 Looking at Freud 1: Phallic objects Stephens-Davidowitz argues that errors in writing and the reported content of dreams do not support simple ‘Freudian slips.’ One method is to look at the popularity of “phallic objects” in dreams, e.g., So what about phallic-shaped foods? Do they sneak into our dreams with unexpected frequency? Nope. Bananas are the second most common fruit to appear in dreams. But they are also the second most commonly consumed fruit. So we don’t need Freud to explain how often we dream about bananas. Cucumbers are the seventh most common vegetable to appear in dreams. They are the seventh most consumed vegetable. So again their shape isn’t necessary to explain their presence in our minds as we sleep. Hot dogs are dreamed of far less frequently than hamburgers. This is true even controlling for the fact that people eat more burgers than dogs. Overall, using a regression analysis (a method that allows social scientists to tease apart the impact of multiple factors) across all fruits and vegetables, I found that a food’s being shaped like a phallus did not give it more likelihood of appearing in dreams than would be expected by its popularity. This theory of Freud’s is falsifiable—and, at least according to my look at the data, false. (47-48) 7.3.3 Looking at Freud 2: Misspellings A more powerful, and perhaps less subjective method, is to systematically study a large sample of human behavior to see if, for example, misspellings are biased towards the sexually symbolic. I studied a dataset of more than 40,000 typing errors collected by Microsoft researchers. The dataset included mistakes that people make but then immediately correct. In these tens of thousands of errors, there were plenty of individuals committing errors of a sexual sort. There was the aforementioned “penistrian.” There was also someone who typed “sexurity” instead of “security” and “cocks” instead of “rocks.” But there were also plenty of innocent slips. People wrote of “pindows” and “fegetables,” “aftermoons” and “refriderators.” So was the number of sexual slips unusual? To test this, I first used the Microsoft dataset to model how frequently people mistakenly switch particular letters. I calculated how often they replace a t with an s, a g with an h. I then created a computer program that made mistakes in the way that people do. We might call it Error Bot. Error Bot replaced a t with an s with the same frequency that humans in the Microsoft study did. It replaced a g with an h as often as they did. And so on. I ran the program on the same words people had gotten wrong in the Microsoft study. In other words, the bot tried to spell “pedestrian” and “rocks,” “windows” and “refrigerator.” But it switched an r with a t as often as people do and wrote, for example, “tocks.” It switched an r with a c as often as humans do and wrote “cocks.” So what do we learn from comparing Error Bot with normally careless humans? After making a few million errors, just from misplacing letters in the ways that humans do, Error Bot had made numerous mistakes of a Freudian nature. It misspelled “seashell” as “sexshell,” “lipstick” as “lipsdick,” and “luckiest” as “fuckiest,” along with many other similar mistakes. And—here’s the key point—Error Bot, which of course does not have a subconscious, was just as likely to make errors that could be perceived as sexual as real people were. With the caveat, as we social scientists like to say, that there needs to be more research, this means that sexually oriented errors are no more likely for humans to make than can be expected by chance. In other words, for people to make errors such as “penistrian,” “sexurity,” and “cocks,” it is not necessary to have some connection between mistakes and the forbidden, some theory of the mind where people reveal their secret desires via their errors. (p. 48-49) 7.3.4 Looking at Freud 3: On the ‘Oedipus complex’ 7.3.4.0.1 What PornHub tells us. a shocking number of people visiting mainstream porn sites are looking for portrayals of incest. Of the top hundred searches by men on PornHub, one of the most popular porn sites, sixteen are looking for incest-themed videos. Fair warning—this is going to get a little graphic: they include “brother and sister,” “step mom fucks son,” “mom and son,” “mom fucks son,” and “real brother and sister.” The plurality of male incestuous searches are for scenes featuring mothers and sons. And women? Nine of the top hundred searches by women on PornHub are for incest-themed videos, and they feature similar imagery—though with the gender of any parent and child who is mentioned usually reversed. Thus the plurality of incestuous searches made by women are for scenes featuring fathers and daughters. (p. 50) Stephens-Davidowitz goes on to argue that, in addition to this seeming support for the centrality (though not universality) of the Oedipus complex, there is additional support for a more generalized notion of infantile sexuality, that is, that many of the sex fantasies for people of all ages invlve themes or ideas from childhood. 7.3.5 Looking at Freud 4: On the hydraulic nature of drives One other Freudian idea is supported by more recent PornHub data. Freud argued for a hydraulic model of drives, that is, that drives were bottled up and that sexual and aggressive energy could be released through catharsis. While this appears not to be true for aggression (that is, behaving aggressively does not reduce subsequent aggression), it is, at some level, supported for sex. At 8:07 on the morning of January 13, cellphones throughout Hawaii received an alert warning that a missile attack was imminent. Thirty-eight minutes later, Hawaiians (and visitors) received a second alert, saying that it was a false alarm. pornHubHawaii What is interesting here is not that PornHub traffic dropped during the missile alert, but that it increased afterwards - as if the average Hawaiian (and tourist) more or less made up for lost time afterwards.

In psychology, the empirical measurement of intelligence, vocational interest, and personality transformed ideas about “individual differences” from speculation to science. Data Science is not new. A good beginning point is Sir Frances Galton (above), who in the late 19th C is alleged to have declared “whenever you can, count.” At about the same time, the French psychologist Alfred Binet sought to better identify schoolchildren with special needs who would particularly benefit from smaller classes. His method was to examine differences between children identified as better versus slower learners on a wide range of tests which might be related to school performance; he combined the successful ones to create the prototype for the modern intelligence test. As Stephens-Davidowitz (2017) recounts, Jeff Seder applies a similar logic to examine the characteristics of horses associated with success. Reminiscent of Binet’s method, Seder finds enlarged left ventricle associated with success. [but now that others know this, left ventricle will not distinguish winners from losers.] There it was, stark and clear, the reason that Seder and his team had become so obsessed with No. 85. His left ventricle was in the 99.61st percentile! Not only that, but all his other important organs, including the rest of his heart and spleen, were exceptionally large as well. Generally speaking, when it comes to racing, Seder had found, the bigger the left ventricle, the better. But a left ventricle as big as this can be a sign of illness if the other organs are tiny. In American Pharoah, all the key organs were bigger than average, and the left ventricle was enormous. The data screamed that No. 85 was a 1-in-100,000 or even a one-in-a-million horse. (p. 70-71). This method has been referred to as “brute force empiricism.” The question here is what works, not why. We may find it interesting to speculate why Strawberry Pop-Tarts are particularly popular in hurricanes (p. 71), but from the standpoint of Wal-Mart and its customers, this is less important than stocking the shelves to satisfy the demand that exists. To predict the quality (as indexed by the price) of Bordeaux wines, a regression equation works well: Price = 12.145 + 0.00117 winter rainfall + 0.0614 average growing season temperature – 0.00386 harvest rainfall. (p. 73) 8.2 The success of Google and the nature of networks Analyses of Google searches can reveal the flu and, perhaps, the unemployment rate. (which is correlated with searches for porn sites and solitaire). Google searches return an ordered list of sites based on a modified Page Rank algorithm, which is a measure of network centrality. Page Rank is what made Google better than early search engines such as Alta Vista. Google as a datasource ((https://medium.com/ ???)()). Includes Google Trends, Google Correlate, and Google books (https://books.google.com/ngrams). Google correlate (I tried this but it is finicky / weeks must begin on a sunday - enter a time series, see what correlates with it.) Data challenge: Find an interesting time series, use google correlate to find something that it is associated with 8.3 Words as data Differences between liberals and conservatives, men and women, the old and young, and extraverts and introverts can be informed by texts ranging from the content of digitized books (Google Ngrams) to posts on social media. Culturenomics (check spelling) can be revealing but is challenging. Historians claim that the Civil War marked a transition from thinking (or writing) about the US as a plural (The United States are…) to a singular (The United States is…). But analyses of the content of books in the Google Ngram corpus revealed that the shift occurred a generation later. There are two lessons here, the specific one about how the image of the US changed more slowly than believed, the other, more general one is that disciplines outside of the sciences are also increasingly informed by the new empiricism. This is true not just for history but also for literature; sentiment analysis can be applied to reveal the structure of stories. (And analyses of Kindle data can reveal just where people stop reading. I’m not sure if contemporary literature is auto-tuned to this, but it is just a matter of time.) [note Gentzkow and Shapiro study of 2005 congressional record] 8.4 Pictures as data Scanned yearbooks from US High schools since 1905 show an increasing number of smiles. New approaches for measuring economic development include lights from space, cell phone snaps at fruit stands. These days, a data scientist must not limit herself to a narrow or traditional view of data. These days, photographs of supermarket lines are valuable data. The fullness of supermarket bins is data. The ripeness of apples is data. Photos from outer space are data. The curvature of lips is data. Everything is data! (p. 104) References "],

People consistently gave wrong information, in ways that made them look good. Fewer than 2 percent reported that they graduated with lower than a 2.5 GPA. (In reality, about 11 percent did.) And 44 percent said they had donated to the university in the past year. (In reality, about 28 percent did.) There are two types of lying that are conflated - lying to ourselves and lying to others. Lying to oneself may explain why so many people say they are above average. How big is this problem? More than 40 percent of one company’s engineers said they are in the top 5 percent. More than 90 percent of college professors say they do above-average work. One-quarter of high school seniors think they are in the top 1 percent in their ability to get along with other people. (p. 107-108). On the Internet… are we more truthful? Google can display a bias toward unseemly thoughts, thoughts people feel they can’t discuss with anyone else. (p. 111). Topics associated with shame and guilt are particularly likely to show a difference between the private and the public. 9.1 Sex What percent of people are gay? Surveys suggest differences between states. But differences in searches for gay porn are far smaller. Many men are in the closet, hiding even from their wives: “Gay” is 10 percent more likely to complete searches that begin “Is my husband . . .” than the second-place word, “cheating.” It is eight times more common than “an alcoholic” and ten times more common than “depressed.” Most tellingly perhaps, searches questioning a husband’s sexuality are far more prevalent in the least tolerant regions. The states with the highest percentage of women asking this question are South Carolina and Louisiana. (p. 116-117). How often do people have sex? On Google, there are sixteen times more complaints about a spouse not wanting sex than about a married partner not being willing to talk. There are five and a half times more complaints about an unmarried partner not wanting sex than an unmarried partner refusing to text back. And Google searches suggest a surprising culprit for many of these sexless relationships. There are twice as many complaints that a boyfriend won’t have sex than that a girlfriend won’t have sex. By far, the number one search complaint about a boyfriend is “My boyfriend won’t have sex with me.” (p. 122-123) What are other people’s sex lives like? when men do look for tips on how to give oral sex, they are frequently not looking for ways of pleasing another person. Men make as many searches looking for ways to perform oral sex on themselves as they do how to give a woman an orgasm. (128) 9.2 Hate and prejudice Stereotypes about other groups as evidenced by autocompletes for “why are [Black] people …” Do these lie in a two dimensional space (competent-incompetent and warm-cold)? Areas where Obama underperformed in 2008 and 2012, relative to Kerry 4 years before, are those where people search for n—— on Google (e.g., n—- jokes). Similarly, in the 2016 Republican Primary, In 2016, support for Trump in the Republican Primary was predicted by searches for n—-. (From my standpoint, this was perhaps Stephens-Davidowitz most important work). These searches outperformed, for example, the performance of regions on the IAT. 9.3 The internet and division People are more likely to encounter someone with different political beliefs on the internet than in many other settings. This is partly because we are likely to have more Facebook than real-world friends, and the “weak ties” between different groups are especially important in conveying information. (I hope that we’ll return to this later when we talk about networks). 9.4 Child abuse and abortion Searches re Child abuse (“my dad hit me) go up in recessions, but child protective services get fewer calls. In 2015, in the United States, there were more than 700,000 Google searches looking into self-induced abortions… there were some 4,000 searches looking for directions on coat hanger abortions, including about 1,300 for the exact phrase “how to do a coat hanger abortion.” There were also a few hundred looking into abortion through bleaching one’s uterus and punching one’s stomach. Search rates for self-induced abortion were fairly steady from 2004 through 2007. They began to rise in late 2008, coinciding with the financial crisis and the recession that followed. They took a big leap in 2011, jumping 40 percent. The Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights organization, singles out 2011 as the beginning of the country’s recent crackdown on abortion; ninety-two state provisions that restrict access to abortion were enacted. Looking by comparison at Canada, which has not seen a crackdown on reproductive rights, there was no comparable increase in searches for self-induced abortions during this time. The state with the highest rate of Google searches for self-induced abortions is Mississippi, a state with roughly three million people and, now, just one abortion clinic. (p. 147-48) 9.5 Be skeptical of the public self: Lesson from Facebook Different sources of Big Data tell different stories, and are susceptible to different biases. Twitter streams, for example, include many bots, and weeding these out from humans can be challenging (and will continue to be challenging as there is likely to be an arms race between bots and algorithms for detecting them). Google searches may be biased toward questions and topics we would be unlikely to share with others, towards the darker aspects of personality. And Facebook data is, in some respects, just the opposite of this, presenting an overly rosy picture of who we are. The notion that our internet self is distorted is not new - the iconic Peter Steiner cartoon below dates from 1993. d Stephens-Davidowitz (2017) illustrates some of the ways in which our social media selves are distorted - we read the Atlantic rather than the National Enquirer for example. Facebook is, he writes “digital brag-to-my-friends-about-how-good-my-life-is serum” (p. 152). Spending time on social media is associated with depressed mood. 9.6 Customers: Lessons from Netflix Behavior is more telling than self report, and as a result, algorithms may know us better than we know ourselves. Netflix no longer asks you to create a queue of movies you would like to watch, because these “aspirational” choices correspond poorly with what we will in fact watch. Netflix learned a similar lesson early on in its life cycle: don’t trust what people tell you; trust what they do. Originally, the company allowed users to create a queue of movies they wanted to watch in the future but didn’t have time for at the moment. This way, when they had more time, Netflix could remind them of those movies. However, Netflix noticed something odd in the data. Users were filling their queues with plenty of movies. But days later, when they were reminded of the movies on the queue, they rarely clicked. What was the problem? Ask users what movies they plan to watch in a few days, and they will fill the queue with aspirational, highbrow films, such as black-and-white World War II documentaries or serious foreign films. A few days later, however, they will want to watch the same movies they usually want to watch: lowbrow comedies or romance films. People were consistently lying to themselves. Faced with this disparity, Netflix stopped asking people to tell them what they wanted to see in the future and started building a model based on millions of clicks and views from similar customers. The company began greeting its users with suggested lists of films based not on what they claimed to like but on what the data said they were likely to view. The result: customers visited Netflix more frequently and watched more movies. “The algorithms know you better than you know yourself,” says Xavier Amatriain, a former data scientist at Netflix. (p. 156-157) 9.7 Can we handle the truth? Should we take this as good news or as bad? Stephens-Davidowitz (2017) suggests that much of this can be comforting - that seeing that others are insecure, are struggling with their sexualities, or are concerned with the mundane rather than profound. It can open our eyes to hidden problems of abuse, and, perhaps most importantly, can point us towards interventions that can reduce hatred.(But political language can be tailored to empirically divide us rather than bring us together as well).

Stephens-Davidowitz (2017) presents evidence in support of an imprinting hypothesis - that there is a critical age. Specifically, the Mets are very popular among those born in 1962 and in 1978 - and the Mets won the World Series in 1968 and 1986. This suggests a critical age of 7 or 8. He considers a study by Ghitza and Gelman, which finds some evidence for a similar effect for politics - that the relevant age is between 14 and 24, at which point the popularity of the incumbent president will shape political ideology for life. What other things might show some imprinting effects, and how might this be assessed? 10.2 Regional effects and contagion Differences between countries in economic mobility are large, and the US does badly, but there are pockets within the US in which this is less true. Why? For the wealthy, life expectancy is not highly related to where one lives. For the poor, however, it is. Stephens-Davidowitz (2017) argues that a good predictor of life expectancy among poor city-dwellers is the “number of rich people who live there.” He argues that this is due to contagion. A more convincing contagion effect is seen in the study of IRS data. People are likely to report self-reported income that maximizes their tax refund; but this effect is highly localized, much more prevalent in places like Miami (30%) than Philadephia (2%). What predicts who is going to cheat? What is it about places that have the greater number of cheaters and those that have lower numbers? We can correlate rates of cheating with other city-level demographics and it turns out that there are two strong predictors: a high concentration of people in the area qualifying for the Earned Income Tax Credit and a high concentration of tax professionals in the neighborhood. What do these factors indicate? Chetty and the authors had an explanation. The key motivator for cheating on your taxes in this manner was information. Most self-employed one-kid taxpayers simply did not know that the magic number for getting a big fat check from the government was $9,000. But living near others who might—either their neighbors or tax assisters—dramatically increased the odds that they would learn about it. (p. 189-190). Stephens-Davidowitz (2017) goes on to examine data such as Wikipedia listings by geographical area, then between-country data on beliefs and concerns about pregnancy. He stratifies data by time, too, and finds that violence rates go down, not up, when violent movies appear. A closer examination of the data revealed that this was particularly true when the young men who were their audience were likely to be in the theater. 10.3 Nearest neighbor analysis PECOTA and baseball doppelgangers. This could, and will, make a difference in the prediciton of health outcomes in the years to come. References "],

Obama campaign and choice of slogan. The lesson of A/B testing, to a large degree, is to be wary of general lessons. Clark Benson is the CEO of ranker.com, a news and entertainment site that relies heavily on A/B testing to choose headlines and site design. “At the end of the day, you can’t assume anything,” Benson says. “Test literally everything.” (p. 216-217) The web you see on your phones and on your PCs is a web that is experimentally designed to hold your attention as effectively and powerfully as possible. You are not immune to this (Alter 2017). 11.2 Natural experiments The value of Super Bowl ads - although they cost millions, there is a ROI of 2 or 3 to 1 : we looked at whether when a company advertises a movie in the Super Bowl, they see a big jump in ticket sales in the cities that had higher viewership for the game. (p. 224) When government or insurance companies change their compensation rates for certain procedures, those procedures change in frequency. Patients derive little if any added benefit from these. 11.2.1 Do schools matter? Effects of prestigious schools is less than it seems… “Elite Illusion.” The effects of Stuyvesant High School? Nil. Nada. Zero. Bupkus. Students on either side of the cutoff ended up with indistinguishable AP scores and indistinguishable SAT scores and attended indistinguishably prestigious universities. The entire reason that Stuy students achieve more in life than non-Stuy students, the researchers concluded, is that better students attend Stuyvesant in the first place. Stuy does not cause you to perform better on AP tests, do better on your SATs, or end up at a better college.* (p. 236) But my analysis of Psych licensing scores. References "],

Mentions the differential variability hypothesis (see also Dangerous idea paper). Then moves on to the question of whether Big Data can predict the stock market - the answer is no. 12.1 The curse of dimensionality With many predictors, some will appear effective by chance. This infects the search for causal and robust relationships, both in scientific hypothesis testing and in everyday life. 12.2 The overemphasis on the measurable Not just pedometers, but baseball offense as opposed to defense, and ways of thinking in which there are right as opposed to insightful and creative answers. In school, the emphasis on speed rather than thoughfulness. 12.3 Ethical concerns Do corporations have the right to judge our fitness for their services based on abstract but statistically predictive criteria not directly related to those services? (p. 261) Casinos know that (problem) gamblers have pain points, points at which their losses will be so large that they will be unlikely to come back to the casino. Casinos will be successful if they can stop gamblers from getting to (rather beyond) this point. Scott Gnau, general manager of Terabyte, explains, in the excellent book Super Crunchers, what casino managers do when they see a regular customer nearing their pain point: “They come out and say, ‘I see you’re having a rough day. I know you like our steakhouse. Here, I’d like you to take your wife to dinner on us right now.’” (p. 264) With more data, more companies will price discriminate, charging not just what the market will bear, but what they can get from us, based upon analysis of ‘doppelgangers’ or nearest neighbors… 12.4 Individual versus group level predictions At an individual level, search data may be effectively useless. 12.5 Conclusion: Data and science Frankly, the overwhelming majority of academics have ignored the data explosion caused by the digital age. The world’s most famous sex researchers stick with the tried and true…for every idea I have talked about in this book, there are a hundred ideas just as important ready to be tackled. For any disease, we can explore Google search data or other digital health data…we can find if there are any tiny pockets of the world where prevalence of this disease is unusually high or unusually low. We might call this—taking a simple method and utilizing Big Data to perform an analysis several hundred times in a short period of time—science at scale. A/B testing can be used to uncover things more fundamental—and socially valuable—than an arrow that gets people to click on an ad. Benjamin F. Jones … has helped create a platform, EDU STAR, which allows for schools to randomly test different lesson plans. … students log in to a computer and are randomly exposed to different lesson plans. Then they take short tests to see how well they learned the material. Schools, in other words, learn what software works best for helping students grasp material. (p. 274-276). References "],

We are concerned not just with the design of graphs, but with our role in society as leaders, as arbiters of facts, as educators. We want to foster data literacy. How do people understand graphs? (NY Times series for schools). How can you use graphs to tell people the truth in a way that they understand? When you see a graph, what do you notice, what do you wonder, and what is the story? Is “story telling” what visualizations should be about? A graph might begin with perception and understanding (the consumer), with knowledge and design values (the producer), but it also reflects the truth of the data. How much is each? 13.2 Some early graphs Visual displays of information reach back to prehistoric times; modern graphs date back, arguably, to Playfair’s 1786 Political Atlas - in which *“… spatial dimensions were used to represent nonspatial, quantitative, idiographic, empirical data. Although it now seems natural to represent, for example, rising and falling imports over time as a rising and falling line, it does not seem to have been done before that time and was quite an accomplishment. Notably, in addition to the statistical line chart, Playfair at one fell swoop single-handedly invented most of the remaining forms of the statistical graphic repertoire used today-the bar chart and histogram, the surface chart, and the circle diagram or”pie chart.“* playfair1786 source The most important early graph is that of Minard. In class, we listened to the 1812 Overture while discussing this. Here’s some background: “*Czar Alexander of Russia sees that Napoleon was becoming too powerful, so he refuses to participate in this embargo. Angry at Czar Alexander’s decision, Napoleon gathers a massive army of over 400,000 to attack Russia in June of 1812. While Russia’s troops are not as numerous as France’s, Russia has a plan. Russian troops keep retreating as Napoleon’s troops move forward, burning everything they pass, ensuring that the French forces could not take anything from their environment. Eventually the French army follows the Russian army all the way to Moscow during October, suffering major losses from lack of food. By the time Napoleon gets to Moscow, he knows he has to retreat. As winter settles into Europe and the temperature drops, Napoleon’s troops suffer even more losses, returning to France from lack of food, disease, and weather conditions.“* (The battle of Borodino, immortalized in Tolstoy’s War and Peace, occurs just before Moscow; the French army loses about 30000 men. Five cannon shots in the overture mark this. And when Napoleon gets to Moscow, he finds that the Russians had razed it before hand, so that there was nothing there for them. Eleven more cannon here.) minard1812 source 13.3 Tukey’s contributions Tukey and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Begins with Tukey 1962 “Future of Data Analysis,” continues with his ultimate publication of EDA in 1977. Tukey decries tallies (prone to error), and shows stem and leaf displays, then box plots. He argues for transforming data to linearity to uncover meaningful relationships, then to examine residuals to look more closely. 13.4 Approaches to graphs A graph might begin with perception and understanding (the consumer), with knowledge and design values (the producer), but it also reflects the truth of the data. How much is each? In thinking about how to design graphs, we can begin with abstract theory, with principles of design informed by our understanding of perception, or with empirical analyses of understanding and memory. 13.5 Tufte: First principles Tufte (2001) describes Graphical Excellence. Graphs should, among other things, “Induce the viewer to think about the substance, rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic productions, or something else.” Graphs should “Present many numbers in a small space, make large data sets coherent, and encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data.” Graphs should “serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation, or decoration [and] be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data set.”&quot; Tufte concludes with the following Principles of Graphical Excellence, which I quote verbatim: Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data—a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design. Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency. Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space. Graphical excellence is nearly always multivariate. And graphical excellence requires telling the truth. ** 13.5.1 An illustration of the cost of bad graphs: The Challenger disaster tufteChallenger tufteChallenger 13.6 Should graphs begin with psychology?
