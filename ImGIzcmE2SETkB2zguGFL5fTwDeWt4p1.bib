  abstract = {Stephens, born biologically male, worked as a funeral director for a corporation that operates Michigan funeral homes. Stephens was terminated shortly after informing the owner, Rost, that she intended to transition and would represent herself as a woman while at work. The EEOC investigated Stephens's allegations of sex discrimination and learned that the Funeral Home provided its male public-facing employees with clothing that complied with its dress code while female public-facing employees received no such allowance. The EEOC sued, alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by terminating Stephens's employment on the basis of her transgender or transitioning status and refusal to conform to sex-based stereotypes and administering a discriminatory clothing policy. The Sixth Circuit ruled in favor of the EEOC. The Funeral Home engaged in unlawful discrimination against Stephens on the basis of her sex and did not establish that applying Title VII's proscriptions against sex discrimination would substantially burden Rost's religious exercise in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Even if Rost's religious exercise were substantially burdened, the EEOC has established that enforcing Title VII is the least restrictive means of furthering the government's compelling interest in eradicating workplace discrimination against Stephens. The EEOC may bring the clothing claim in this case because an investigation into the clothing-allowance policy was reasonably expected to grow out of the original discrimination charge.},

Problems with the functional approach are identified, notably limitations to the assumption of the adaptiveness of behavior, and confusion of functional and causal explanations. Advantages of the functional approach include providing an integrated viewpoint concerning behavior and aiding studies of the mechanisms controlling behavior. Sociobiology's predictive hypotheses are as yet limited.},

Her proposed model aims to account for the normative boundaries of sex and gender, especially between females, transwomen, and intersexuals, in terms of a `gender line' on which different gender categories are located. This reply paper aims to clear the fuzziness in Tauchert's model by pointing out two critical problems. First, her model appears to be self-defeating, since the marginalized gender categories it attempts to empower are defined in terms of the hegemonic binarism of the `pure' heterosexual male and the `pure' heterosexual female, which it tries to dislodge. Second, her model implies an infinite number of possible gender categories along the gender line; being so, it becomes theoretically inert and practically inadequate. In lieu of the fuzzy model, this paper suggests an alternative model of thinking through the black/white and grey gender categories. This model utilizes the metaphor of gender galaxies, where each gender category is treated as an independent, socially-conferred galaxy; each having specific societal concerns and political agenda. This model, as will be argued, provides firmer grounding for the political aspirations of these various gender categories.},

Most competitive sports have male and female categories. One of the primary challenges with this categorization system, however, is that some transgender athletes (and especially transgender women) may be prevented from competing in accordance with their gender identity. The reason for this restriction is because of the idea that transgender women have an unfair advantage over their cisgender counterparts; this is seen as a problem since sports are typically guided a principle called \&lsquo;the skill thesis\&rsquo;, which suggests that sports are supposed to determine who is most skillful by maintaining a fair starting point. In this paper, I argue that if the skill thesis ought to be maintained and there continues to exist no conclusive evidence in support of unfair advantages possessed by trans women, then we may want to re-consider the gender binary in sport. Rather than having male/female categories, it may make more sense to categorize athletes based other sport-specific factors (e.g., height, weight, etc.). This may help to maintain the skill thesis while at the same time removing potentially unfair and discriminatory barriers against transgender athletes.},

By focusing on the early conceptual aspects of Bem's research, we describe three related but distinct impacts of that work. One impact was a social justice message of equality between women and men in the United States. A second impact was focusing research attention on gender roles as a malleable, socially constructed phenomena that, when polarized across gender groups, had negative consequences for psychological well-being. A third less obvious impact was helping scholars divest themselves of the previous, narrow understanding that gender was ultimately collapsible into a single dimension of masculinity\textendash{}femininity. As with any new concept for its time, the legacy of psychological androgyny featured both backslides into and advances against the previous understanding of gender that it was designed to challenge. Our discussion of what we believe to be key functions and impacts of the concept of psychological androgyny serves to underscore just how important its introduction was and still is for ongoing gender scholarship and research.},

The assumptions and evidence presumably supportive of Rushton's sociobiological perspective are reviewed and critiqued. The concept of ``race'' is politically defined; the Darwinian arguments are teleological; theoretical constructs are flawed; and the empirical data bases are frequently misrepresented.

In this paper several views on the fuzziness of concepts are pointed out to have stemmed from dubious concepts of fuzziness. The underlying notions of the roles feasibly played by prototype, set, and probability in modeling concepts strongly suggest that the controversy originates from a vague relation between intuitive and mathematical ideas in the cognitive sciences. It is argued that the application of fuzzy sets cannot resolve this vagueness since they are one sided, viz., defined on sets. An alternative definition based on classes (in the sense of axiomatic set theory) is proposed.},

This research advances knowledge that can foster cross-cultural understanding in a world of increasing global interdependence and has implications for modeling cultural change.

Plaintiff also claimed that her constitutional rights were violated because defendant terminated her employment due to her medical condition, known as Gender Identity Disorder. The district court granted summary judgment to plaintiff on her sex discrimination claim and granted summary judgment to defendant on plaintiff's medical discrimination claim. Both parties timely appealed. The court held that a government agent violated the Equal Protection Clause's prohibition of sex-based discrimination when he or she fired a transgender or transsexual employee because of his or her gender non-conformity. The court also held that defendant had advanced no reason that could qualify as a governmental purpose, much less an "important" governmental purpose, and even less than that, a "sufficiently important government purpose" that was achieved by firing plaintiff because of her gender non-conformity. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff on her sex-discrimination claim. In light of this decision, which provided plaintiff with all the relief she sought, there was no need to address plaintiff's cross-appeal.},

This review summarizes major theories designed to explain gender differences: evolutionary theories, cognitive social learning theory, sociocultural theory, and expectancy-value theory. The gender similarities hypothesis raises the possibility of theorizing gender similarities. Statistical methods for the analysis of gender differences and similarities are reviewed, including effect sizes, meta-analysis, taxometric analysis, and equivalence testing. Then, relying mainly on evidence from meta-analyses, gender differences are reviewed in cognitive performance (e.g., math performance), personality and social behaviors (e.g., temperament, emotions, aggression, and leadership), and psychological well-being. The evidence on gender differences in variance is summarized. The final sections explore applications of intersectionality and directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Human groups have long faced ecological threats such as resource stress and warfare, and must also overcome strains on coordination and cooperation that are imposed by growing social complexity. How do societies adapt to these challenges? Tightness-looseness (TL) theory suggests that ecological threat and social complexity both lead societies to become culturally tighter, with stronger norms and harsher punishment of deviant behavior. TL theory further predicts that tightening is associated with changes to political structure and intergroup relations. Building on research that tests TL theory's predictions in contemporary nations and states, we conduct a large-scale test of TL theory in 86 non-industrial societies. We show that tightness covaries across domains of social norms (e.g. socialization, law, gender) in these societies, suggesting that it is a domain-general facet of culture. We replicate many past findings from TL theory: tightness correlates positively with several ecological threats, including pathogen prevalence, population pressure, scarcity, and several forms of warfare. Finally, we provide evidence for several new predictions from TL theory. Tightness correlates positively with social complexity, authoritarian leadership, patrilocality, and negatively with contact between societies. These analyses replicate several nation-level and state-level findings while also uncovering new insights into human culture. We also provide metrics that can be used by future studies on cultural tightness in the ethnographic record.},

Also, this commentary provides advice for incorporating the developmental context in research on gender identity.

The fundamental notion of reference sets is examined in detail, hence highlighting their importance. A systematic and combinatorial classification of the relevant subsets of the legal field is supplied for practical application. Although the use of the fuzzy sets theory is sometimes suggested as a palliative measure (no competition exists), it can also be complementary (serve as a building block to improve modelisation).

  abstract = {Tested three hypotheses with regard to the differences among four sex-role types. Ss were 423 girls and 225 boys in five private high schools in grades 9 to 12. Each volunteer S completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory, the Interpersonal Style Inventory, and Loevinger's Sentence Completion Test. Ss were categorized or typed as Masculine, Feminine, Androgynous, and Undifferentiated on the basis of their masculine and feminine BSRI scores. A discriminant fucntion was applied to compare the groups with respect to the ISI scores. The first dimension of difference for both sexes was defined by the Masculine typed group and the second dimension by the Feminine typed group. The Androgynous typed group scored high on both axes, while the Undifferentiated scored low on both axes. The Masculine typed group was most directive, achieving, and independent. The Feminine group was highest on nurturance, tolerance and sensitivity. The Androgynous members were balanced with respect to the above characteristics. Comparison of the groups, separated by sex, as to ego development score, indicated that the male undifferentiated were significantly lower.},

I draw on recent queer theory, transgender studies, and Michel Foucault's work, including what he refers to in the 1977\textendash{}78 Coll{\`e}ge de France lectures as ``a triangle: sovereignty, discipline, and governmental management.'' All three of these techniques of power operate within prisons, from the use of violent sovereign power in physical and sexual assaults to the gendered disciplinary norms involved in rules about prisoners' clothing and appearance. The management of populations through biopower occurs throughout these prison systems, including in the categorization of prisoners by sex or gender, in their placement in a men's or women's facility, and in government statistics about prison populations. I present a brief comparison of gender recognition policies in the United Kingdom and the United States and then analyze the role of the English and American prison systems in constructing sex and gender identities. Gendered power dynamics are particularly evident in the policies and practices toward transgender prisoners in the United States, who are often placed in inappropriate facilities, face high rates of violence and rape, and are erased from official reports and statistics. Just as Foucault used his analysis of the prison to show how disciplinary power operates in broader society, I conclude that contemporary prisons constitute and reinforce binary sex identities, normative gender identities, and violent forms of masculinity.},

Males are known to have larger brain volumes, though the patterns of differences across brain subregions have typically only been examined in small, inconsistent studies [5]. In addition, despite common findings of greater male variability in traits like intelligence [6], personality [7], and physical performance [8], variance differences in the brain have received little attention. Here we report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain to date (2,750 female and 2,466 male participants aged 44-77 years). Males had higher cortical and sub-cortical volumes, cortical surface areas, and white matter diffusion directionality; females had thicker cortices and higher white matter tract complexity. Considerable overlap between the distributions for males and females was common, and subregional differences were smaller after accounting for global differences. There was generally greater male variance across structural measures. The modestly higher male score on two cognitive tests was partly mediated via structural differences. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale characterisation of neurobiological sex differences provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes of sex differences in brain structure and function, and their associated psychological and psychiatric consequences.},

  abstract = {Intersectionality is receiving increasing attention in many fields, including psychology. This theory or framework has its roots in the work of Black feminist scholar-activists, and it focuses on interlocking systems of oppression and the need to work toward structural-level changes to promote social justice and equity. Thus, the current interest in intersectionality in psychology presents an opportunity to draw psychologists' attention more to structural-level issues and to make social justice and equity more central agendas to the field. The large, ever-growing bodies of research demonstrating the wide-ranging adverse consequences of structural- and interpersonal-level oppression, inequality, and stigma for the health and well-being of many diverse groups of people support that these issues are central to the field of psychology. We as individual psychologists and the field as a whole can work to fully incorporate the insights of intersectionality and therefore contribute to making social justice and equity more central across the varied subfields and realms of our work. Specific ways that we can do this are to (a) engage and collaborate with communities, (b) address and critique societal structures, (c) work together/build coalitions, (d) attend to resistance in addition to resilience, and (e) teach social justice curricula. There are important examples both within and outside of psychology that can guide us in achieving these goals. These suggestions are meant to foster conversation and consideration by psychologists across all subfields and areas of focus. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Second, how might social science understandings of sex and gender, and gender differences in health, become more integrated into scholarship in this area? We review articles on genetics and health published in selected peer-reviewed journals. Although sex is included frequently as a control or stratifying variable, few articles articulate a conceptual frame or methodological justification for conducting research in this way, and most are not motivated by sex or gender differences in health. Gender differences in health are persistent, unexplained, and shaped by multilevel social factors. Future scholarship on genetics and health needs to incorporate more systematic attention to sex and gender, gender as an environment, and the intertwining of social and biological variation over the life course. Such integration will advance understandings of gender differences in health, and may yield insight regarding the processes and circumstances that make genomic variation relevant for health and well-being.},

It argues that, although there is no definitive evidence in support of any of these three major explanatory paradigms, the cultural and biological deterministic paradigms are difficult to reconcile with a good deal of empirical evidence.

  abstract = {This paper raises the question of female-embodied subjectivity as impacting on transgendered and intersexed claims to subjectivity. Recent theoretical work, from Butler to Zizek, 'deconstructs' sexual difference, and in the process repeats the familiar gesture of erasing the specificities of female-embodied subjectivity. Recent feminist theory (especially Battersby, Grosz and Gatens, and central to Irigaray) attempts a delineation of female-embodied subjectivity, resisting the current anti-essentialist trend in gender theory. The foreclosing of debate around an ontology of female-embodiment performed by anti-essentialist dictums is answered by a 'new essentialism' in feminist theory. Between the concerns of the 'autonomous' female subject and claims to transgendered and intersexed subjectivity, female-embodiment remains suspended between reification (na{\"i}ve essentialism) and cultural erasure. 'Fuzzy gender' (fuzzy logic applied to gender theory) offers a model for mobilising female-embodied subjectivity as a political and theoretical figure resistant to institutional embodiment. Through 'fuzzy gender' we comprehend binary sexual difference as an instance of the part mistaking itself for the whole, and negotiate the wake of the receding Aristotelian model of difference without collapsing into atomised relativity. In the end, 'fuzzy gender' argues for theoretical coalition between feminist, transgendered, and intersexed concerns, in the context of an unrepentantly masculine body-politic.},

  abstract = {The application of sociobiological concepts such as sexual selection and parental investment to the understanding of human behavior has been accorded credibility by the appearance of scientific objectivity, but has also contributed to a persistent sexism that is detailed in this paper. Basic assumptions of sociobiological theories of sexual selection and parental investment are outlined, and both the theoretical limits and contradictory data associated with these concepts are reviewed. We argue that the persistent widespread adherence to simplified and often erroneous models derived from these concepts reflects a social construction of gender that is relatively independent of the facts. Several mechanisms by which this social construction is accomplished are discussed, including androcentric reference points, prejudicial language, biased selection of examples, deprecation of environmental and contextual factors, and differential application of standards of evidence.},

  abstract = {Concepts such as risk aversion and anxiety have received renewed attention in various strands of gender and politics research. Most contemporary scholars suggest that gender gaps in this area are related to social norms and stem from social learning rather than from inherent gender traits. Very few, however, elaborate on the gender variable to reach a fuller understanding of the dynamics at work. In this study, we examined gender gaps in levels of anxiety, an area closely related to risk aversion, and we applied a combination of categorical measures of gender distinguishing between ``woman, ``man,'' and ``other'' and scales capturing grades of femininity and masculinity in individuals. We label this approach fuzzy gender, and we suggest that it can be used to advance research in our field. The key finding is an interaction effect between categorical measures of gender and fuzzy gender: The more female characteristics in women, the higher the levels of anxiety. Moreover, there is no difference in levels of anxiety between men and women with few female characteristics. The data used draw from a large-scale survey among Swedish citizens in 2013.},

  abstract = {Gender identity reflects people's understanding of themselves in terms of cultural definitions of female and male. In this article, we identify two traditions of research on gender identity that capture different aspects of masculine and feminine gender roles. The classic personality approach to gender identity differentiates communal from agentic traits and interests. The gender self-categorization approach comprises identification with the social category of women or men. Based on the compatibility principle, each approach should predict behaviors within the relevant content domain. Thus, personality measures likely predict communal and agentic behaviors, whereas gender self-categorization measures likely predict group-level reactions such as ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. Researchers have the option of using one or the other conception of gender identity, depending on their particular question of interest. Relying primarily on research conducted in the U.S., we show that both traditions provide insight into the ways that gendered self concepts link the social roles of women and men with their individual cognitions, emotions, and behaviors.},
