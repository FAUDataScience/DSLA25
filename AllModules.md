# (PART) Part I {Introduction}

# Preface

(This is a markdown text for sketching out list and order of modules. Each module will be set up as a separate Rmd file, "Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #." (Xie, 2017))

My goal in writing this is to overcome Max Planck's Principle - to improve my own rudimentary understanding of many of the techniques in this field. My background includes... but I am really a novice in this field, working just ahead of or alongside my colleague Warren McGovern and my students at the Wilkes Honors College of FAU.

      A second dimension - literacy (can understand) to fluency (can practice) to leadership (can create new solutions or methods). 
      (Later in the class - how would you write code to draw this in R or Tableau? )

# Pretest

What do you know about data science, and what are your goals for the term?  Express these in terms of the matrix described above.
" Your grade in the class will be based not just on what you know at the end of the term, but how much you have learned.

Is it possible to incentivize students to do as well as they can on this first exam - to use our honor code to insure that they don't 'cheat down' as they would not 'cheat up'?

Thinking that residualized final exam performance will be worth x % of grade (i.e., that students who have learned more than the typical student will receive a boost. Might fold this in to a participation/effort score).

Better still is to use the pretest to identify students with expertise in particular areas - these students can earn points by helping others.

So you can earn points by (a) learning more about particular topics than most of your classmates and/or by (b) helping your classmates with particular topics.

Because the range of expertise required in the course is broad, every student will be identified as having one or more strengths,  

# Setting up your computer

Markdown and Slack as the first tools
R and RStudio as necessary
Gephi, Tableau as optional.

# What about big data (Data and society)

A revolution in the social sciences. 

Introduction: Power of Google trends (which example is most compelling?). 

Chapters 1 and 2: Thinking like a data scientist. Empiricism > intuition. Four powers of Big Data.

Chapter 3-4: The internet as a network. Google searches and the Page Rank algorithm. Google flu. 

Google as a datasource (https://medium.com/@pewresearch/using-google-trends-data-for-research-here-are-6-questions-to-ask-a7097f5fb526)

> Google correlate (I tried this but it is finicky / weeks must begin on a sunday - enter a time series, see what correlates with it.) *Data challenge: Find an interesting time series, use google correlate to find something that it is associated with*

# Tools for data: The simple spreadsheet 

From hand-tally to calculator to spreadsheet

Best practices for data in spreadsheets [@broman2017data]. 

Advantages and disadvantages of working with spreadsheets. Tidy, rectangular data allows people and computers to see data in the same way.

# Beyond spreadsheets (introduction)

Spreadsheets are great, but limited in some ways.  They are good at showing us raw data, but not the history of how it has been transformed or analyzed. They can be cumbersome for working with large datasets, too.

# An introduction to R (R)

R is a system for Reproducible science.
R is a system for Representing data in cool, insight-facilitating ways.
R is Really popular, and really gRowing.
Historically, R grew out of S which could stand for Statistics. In the univeRse of data science classes, R is closeR to statistics than computer science. 
LeaRning R is woRthwhile and it will make you a more attractive candidate for many graduate programs as well as jobs in the private sector.
But "learning R" is a misnomer, as it implies a discrete accomplishment that one can master, Rather, R is a system of applications and tools which is so vast that there is always more that one can achieve.

There are many tools out there that can help you learn R, including SwirlR, DataCamp, the Data Science Certificate Program at Hopkins, your classmates, and the present text.

R syntax is finicky.  You will make errors constantly, but because so many other people are using R, you can generally find answers quickly with a Google search. (This achievement of scale is a characteristic feature of many aspects of our data-connected world, one in which popular restaraunts, hotels, ... )
