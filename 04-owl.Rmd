There are many sources for learning the basics of R. A few of these follow.  Please **spend at least 90 mins exploring at least two of the following.** Be prepared to discuss your progress next class (you will be asked which source(s) you used, what you struggled with, and whether you would recommend it to your classmates. (Note that all of these are free, though you may choose to make a donation to the author if you use the Peng text).

>   **Hint:** If you find the material too challenging - if you feel like you are drawing the rest of the owl - take a break away from your machine and other screens, clear your head, then try a different approach.

## Carmichael

Iain Carmichael prepared the following for his Intro to Data Science course at UNC-Chapel Hill. I think it is a great place to start: https://idc9.github.io/stor390/notes/getting_started/getting_started.html

## DataCamp

Many folks swear by (and others, I presume, at) DataCamp, which kind of gamifies learning software.  As a student in this class, you have access to all of their stuff... free. You can even do lessons on your phone.

## Swirl (Swirlstats)

I, like thousands of others, learned R in the process of completing the Johns Hopkins [Data Science Specialization](https://jhudatascience.org/courses.html) offered through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The sequence can be challenging, but their introduction to R used an accessible, interactive R package called *Swirl.* You can read about swirl ("learn R in R") at https://swirlstats.com/.  

**Using Swirl.** After loading R (and opening R studio), you will get to the Swirl lessons with the following steps: 

1) Install the Swirl package on your computer (you only need to do this once). Type the following into your console window in R studio (typically left hand side of your screen or lower left)

>   install.packages("swirl") 

2) Then load the package into your workspace (you'll need to do this at the beginning of every session you use Swirl) 

>   library (swirl)

2) Then run it! 

>   swirl ()

Swirl will ask a few questions then give you the option of choosing one of several courses. You'll choose the R Programming option, which leads to 15 separate lessons.

At the end of each lesson, you'll be asked 

>   *Would you like to receive credit for completing this course on Coursera.org?*

Answer no... then do another lesson.

## Peng text and videos

Finally, consider the text and videos from the Coursera R class.  Most of the material from that class can be found in @peng2015r.  A slightly updated version of the text can be found at https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/, and the videos in the series may be found by clicking on the following:

## Something else

The "something else" category includes Datacarpentry.org, which is aimed at fostering data literacy and provides free lessons for learning and applying R in areas such as [Ecology](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/), [Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/) and [Geospatial data analysis](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/). Of particular interest are the [social science](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) lessons, as well as a workshop in data science based on the "[Studying African Farmer-led Irrigation (SAFI)" dataset](https://datacarpentry.org/socialsci-workshop/).

## Exercise

Review Carmichael's [Getting started with R](https://idc9.github.io/stor390/notes/getting_started/getting_started.html).  Open R studio, and create a new R script called myMovies.R. Using his code as a reference, do each of the following

1. Work in your source window. On the first line, enter the command to install the tidyverse, using the chunk below - but omit the [octothorpe](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/octothorpe). (If you've already installed the tidyverse, keep the #).

   ```
   # install.packages ("tidyverse")
   ```

   Hit ctrl+enter to run this line. Now comment it out if you haven't already done so (why)?

2. Load the tidyverse into your workspace. 

3. Load the movies/IMDB dataset.

4. Start exploring the data and the RStudio interface:

   - Apply the str (structure), head, and summary commands. When are each of these useful?
   - Double-click the movies dataset in your environment tab in R studio. Click on a few columns to sort the data.
   - In the data, what does 'spilled' mean? How did you find out?

5. How many rows and columns are in the data? 

6. We can think about the movies dataset as a matrix with rows and columns, and *subset* it using the following. 
   ```
   # data.frame[rownumber,colnumber]
   # data.frame["rowname", "colname"]
   # data.frame[rowname, c("colname, colname")]
   movies["title"]
   movies[title]
   movies[title,]
   ```

7. Ask an interesting question about the data, and enter it as a comment in your code, e.g., 

   ``` # how long was the movie 42-up? ```

8. Try to find the answer, ideally using reproducible code, and be prepared to share it with the class.

9. Save your work :)
