# hello world

It's time to start moving ahead with R. You can expect a few moments where you feel like you are drawing an owl (origin unknown), but persist!

## Wickham and R for Data Science

The first chapter of the Wickham text provides a framework for his approach and a brief introduction to the *tidyverse.*

After you have read this, please **spend at least 90 mins** exploring at least one of the following. Be prepared to discuss your progress next class (you will be asked which source(s) you used, what you struggled with, and whether you would recommend it to your classmates:

## Additional sources:

### Carmichael

Iain Carmichael prepared the following for his Intro to Data Science course at UNC-Chapel Hill. I think it is a great place to start: https://idc9.github.io/stor390/notes/getting_started/getting_started.html

### DataCamp

Many folks swear by (and others, I presume, at) DataCamp, which kind of gamifies learning software.  As a student in this class, you have access to all of their stuff... free. You can even do lessons on your phone.

### Swirl (Swirlstats)

I, like thousands of others, learned R in the process of completing the Johns Hopkins [Data Science Specialization](https://jhudatascience.org/courses.html) offered through Coursera. The sequence can be challenging, but their introduction to R used an accessible, interactive R package called *Swirl.* You can read about swirl ("learn R in R") at https://swirlstats.com/.  

**Using Swirl.** After loading R (and opening R studio), you will get to the Swirl lessons with the following steps: 

1) Install the Swirl package on your computer (you only need to do this once). Type the following into your console window in R studio (typically left hand side of your screen or lower left)

>   install.packages("swirl") 

2) Then load the package into your workspace (you'll need to do this at the beginning of every session you use Swirl) 

>   library (swirl)

2) Then run it! 

>   swirl ()

Swirl will ask a few questions then give you the option of choosing one of several courses. You'll choose the R Programming option, which leads to 15 separate lessons.

At the end of each lesson, you'll be asked 

>   *Would you like to receive credit for completing this course on Coursera.org?*

Answer no... then do another lesson.

### Peng text and videos

Finally, consider the text and videos from the Coursera R class.  Most of the material from that class can be found in @peng2015r.  A slightly updated version of the text can be found at https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/, and the videos in the series may be found by clicking on the following:
