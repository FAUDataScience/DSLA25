# more wrangling

In this chapter, we consider the following topics:

working with missing (NA are contagious; R4DS 2e, chap 12)
logical operators and subsetting (R4DS 2e, chap 12)

eda
modular arithmetic (R4DS 2e, chap 13)
rounding and communication
transformations and Tukey (log, ranks, standardization)
mean and median

joining dataframes

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
