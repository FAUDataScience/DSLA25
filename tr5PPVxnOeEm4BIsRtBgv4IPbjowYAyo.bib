  abstract = {Synesthesia is a psychological phenomenon where sensory signals become mixed. Input to one sensory modality produces an experience in a second, unstimulated modality. In ``grapheme-color synesthesia'', viewed letters and numbers evoke mental imagery of colors. The study of this condition has implications for increasing our understanding of brain architecture and function, language, memory and semantics, and the nature of consciousness. In this work, we propose a novel application of deep learning to model perception in grapheme-color synesthesia. Achromatic letter images, taken from database of handwritten characters, are used to train the model, and to induce computational synesthesia. Results show the model learns to accurately create a colored version of the inducing stimulus, according to a statistical distribution from experiments on a sample population of grapheme-color synesthetes. To the author's knowledge, this work represents the first model that accurately produces spontaneous, creative mental imagery characteristic of the synesthetic perceptual experience. Experiments in cognitive science have contributed to our understanding of some of the observable behavioral effects of synesthesia, and previous models have outlined neural mechanisms that may account for these observations. A model of synesthesia that generates testable predictions on brain activity and behavior is needed to complement large scale data collection efforts in neuroscience, especially when articulating simple descriptions of cause (stimulus) and effect (behavior). The research and modeling approach reported here provides a framework that begins to address this need.},

  abstract = {Synesthesia is a condition where presentation of one perceptual class consistently evokes additional experiences in different perceptual categories. Synesthesia is widely considered a congenital condition, although an alternative view is that it is underpinned by repeated exposure to combined perceptual features at key developmental stages. Here we explore the potential for repeated associative learning to shape and engender synesthetic experiences. Non-synesthetic adult participants engaged in an extensive training regime that involved adaptive memory and reading tasks, designed to reinforce 13 specific letter-color associations. Following training, subjects exhibited a range of standard behavioral and physiological markers for grapheme-color synesthesia; crucially, most also described perceiving color experiences for achromatic letters, inside and outside the lab, where such experiences are usually considered the hallmark of genuine synesthetes. Collectively our results are consistent with developmental accounts of synesthesia and illuminate a previously unsuspected potential for new learning to shape perceptual experience, even in adulthood.},

The psychometric stability of the back-translated English items of the IUI as well as the incremental variance of Parts A and B remain to be assessed. The current study involved 2 samples of English-speaking community participants (n Ï­ 437 and n Ï­ 309; 73\% women and 27\% men) who completed the IUI and several related measures. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses suggested a refinement of IUI items as well as a unitary structure for Part A and a 3-factor structure for Part B. Regression results suggested Parts A and B each provide incremental validity in measures of worry, generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, negative problem orientation, and depression. Comprehensive results, implications, and future research directions are discussed.},

Our findings challenge that conclusion. Participants provided intolerance judgments of several targets and the political objective of these targets (left-wing vs. right-wing) was varied between subjects. Across seven judgments, conservatism predicted intolerance of left-wing targets, while liberalism predicted intolerance of right-wing targets. These relationships were fully mediated by perceived threat from targets. Moreover, participants were biased against directly opposing political targets: conservatives were more intolerant of a left-wing target than the opposing right-wing target (e.g., pro-gay vs. anti-gay rights activists), while liberals were more intolerant of a right-wing target than the opposing left-wing target. These findings are discussed within the context of the existing political intolerance and motivated reasoning literatures.},

Synesthetes rarely talk about their peculiar sensory gift\textemdash{}believing either that everyone else senses the world exactly as they do, or that no one else does. Yet synesthesia occurs in one in twenty people, and is even more common among artists. One famous synesthete was novelist Vladimir Nabokov, who insisted as a toddler that the colors on his wooden alphabet blocks were ``all wrong.'' His mother understood exactly what he meant because she, too, had synesthesia. Nabokov's son Dmitri, who recounts this tale in the afterword to this book, is also a synesthete\textemdash{}further illustrating how synesthesia runs in families. In Wednesday Is Indigo Blue, pioneering researcher Richard Cytowic and distinguished neuroscientist David Eagleman explain the neuroscience and genetics behind synesthesia's multisensory experiences. Because synesthesia contradicted existing theory, Cytowic spent twenty years persuading colleagues that it was a real\textemdash{}and important\textemdash{}brain phenomenon rather than a mere curiosity. Today scientists in fifteen countries are exploring synesthesia and how it is changing the traditional view of how the brain works. Cytowic and Eagleman argue that perception is already multisensory, though for most of us its multiple dimensions exist beyond the reach of consciousness. Reality, they point out, is more subjective than most people realize. No mere curiosity, synesthesia is a window on the mind and brain, highlighting the amazing differences in the way people see the world.},

The General Sleep Experiences Scale (GSE) of the Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey (ISES) correlated with measures of absorption, dissociation, negative affect, and lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming and negative affect were significantly yet weakly correlated. Regression analysis indicated that negative affect and absorption were significant predictors of GSE scores. All the variables combined, including absorption and measures of dissociation, accounted for 38\% of GSE variance. Hypnotic responsiveness was not associated with lucid dreaming, dissociation, or the GSE. However, a subset of ISES items were significant predictors of suggestibility. Moreover, our results suggested that absorption may be at the heart of the link between the ISES and dissociation, and that there is a modicum of continuity of waking and sleep-related experiences.},

Reasons for the deviation from Lile's theory are explored, implications of these findings are discussed, and new directions for this structural view of identity are proposed.},

  abstract = {The last couple of years have seen a rapid growth of interest (especially amongst cognitive psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists, and developmental researchers) in the study of crossmodal correspondences \textendash{} the tendency for our brains (not to mention the brains of other species) to preferentially associate certain features or dimensions of stimuli across the senses. By now, robust empirical evidence supports the existence of numerous crossmodal correspondences, affecting people's performance across a wide range of psychological tasks \textendash{} in everything from the redundant target effect paradigm through to studies of the Implicit Association Test, and from speeded discrimination/classification tasks through to unspeeded spatial localisation and temporal order judgment tasks. However, one question that has yet to receive a satisfactory answer is whether crossmodal correspondences automatically affect people's performance (in all, or at least in a subset of tasks), as opposed to reflecting more of a strategic, or top-down, phenomenon. Here, we review the latest research on the topic of crossmodal correspondences to have addressed this issue. We argue that answering the question will require researchers to be more precise in terms of defining what exactly automaticity entails. Furthermore, one's answer to the automaticity question may also hinge on the answer to a second question: Namely, whether crossmodal correspondences are all `of a kind', or whether instead there may be several different kinds of crossmodal mapping (e.g., statistical, structural, and semantic). Different answers to the automaticity question may then be revealed depending on the type of correspondence under consideration. We make a number of suggestions for future research that might help to determine just how automatic crossmodal correspondences really are.},

  abstract = {Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which one or more sensory modalities become linked. However, for over a century, the term synesthesia has also been used to refer to artistic and poetic devices which attempt to express a linkage between the senses.  To better understand the influence of synesthesia in popular culture and the way it is viewed by non-synesthetes, it is informative to examine books in which one of the main characters is portrayed as experiencing synesthesia.  In addition to these fictional portrayals, the way in which synesthesia is presented in non-fiction books to non-specialist audiences is instructive.  Author and synesthete Patricia Lynne Duffy has described four ways in which synesthete characters have been used in modern fiction.
Not all of the depictions of synesthesia in the fictional works are accurate.  Some are highly inaccurate and reflect more about the author's interpretation of synesthesia than about the phenomenon itself.  The scientific works are intended to be accurate depictions of synesthetic experiences.  However, as research advances some of the specific details in those accounts may be superseded or corrected by subsequent studies.},

  abstract = {This paper examined the relations between experiential permeability (the maladaptive aspects of openness to experience) and the constructs of schizotypy, psychoticism, dissociation, and sleep disturbances. Using a crosssectional design with self- and informant ratings, Study 1 (N = 241) found moderate to strong associations between high experiential permeability facets (i.e., odd and eccentric, unrestricted self) and these external correlates. Low permeability (i.e., superficial orientation toward experiences) was strongly linked to negative symptoms of schizotypy. Study 2 (N = 87) employed an experience-sampling methodology to examine the relations between experiential permeability and manifestations of schizotypy symptoms in daily life. Results suggest that eccentric individuals (i.e., with high permeability) experienced elevated daily symptoms when they encountered stress whereas superficial individuals (i.e., with low permeability) showed high levels of daily symptoms regardless of environmental stresses. Overall, the present research provided novel empirical data linking schizotypy and related symptoms to maladaptive aspects of openness.},

The first part of the review considers the characteristics of synesthesia: its elicited nature, automaticity, prevalence, and consistency, and its perceptual and spatial phenomenology. The second part considers the causes of synesthesia both in terms of candidate neural mechanisms and the distal influences that shape this: genetic differences in developmental synesthesia and plasticity following sensory loss in acquired synesthesia. The final part considers developmental synesthesia as an individual difference in cognition and summarizes evidence of its influence on perception, imagery, memory, art/creativity, and numeracy.},
