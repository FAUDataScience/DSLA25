  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The situations in which patients prefer a male or female nurse are not clear, as the literature reports differing relationships between gender and preference. Furthermore, most research has focused on female preferences.
METHODS: This questionnaire study investigated the preferences of both males and females for a male or female nurse, depending on four clinical situations. The role of age and previous experience with a male nurse was also taken into account. Gender, age and experience were further examined in relation to attitudes towards professional nursing practice. To determine whether preferences and attitudes have changed over time, the study was replicated in 2000, having been first conducted in 1984. Data were collected from the same general practice waiting room on each occasion.
RESULTS: Consistent with previous research, the degree of intimacy in a clinical situation was found to be predictive of same-gender preferences. Younger females may prefer female nurses more than older females. Experience with male nurses was limited in both samples, but was not predictive of preferences or attitudes.
CONCLUSIONS: Generally speaking, results from 1984 and 2000 were not significantly different. As a quantitative study, this research contributes to an understanding of patient preferences. However, in-depth, qualitative research is recommended to understand better the reasons for preferences and attitudes, for both male and female patients.},

  abstract = {(Hochschild 1983) coined the term status shield to theorize men's status-based protection from the emotional abuses of working in a service job and hence their diminished need to manage emotions as compared to women. Extending this concept, the current study examines how gender operates not merely to shield men from emotional labor on the job but to also shape the relationship between emotional labor and job satisfaction. Using survey data collected from 730 registered nurses (667 women and 63 men) at a large Midwestern hospital system in the U.S., we show that in addition to engaging in less emotional labor than women, men benefit from their emotion management in ways that women do not. Gender moderates the relationship between two dimensions of emotional labor (i.e., surface acting\textemdash{}covering emotion and deep acting) and two outcome measures (i.e., job satisfaction and turnover intention). Results support theoretical claims that men's privileged status shields them from having to perform emotional labor as frequently as women. Further, when male nurses do perform higher levels of emotional labor, they are shielded from the negative effects of covering emotion and their deep acting correlates with higher job satisfaction\textemdash{}a status bonus\textemdash{}compared to that of their female colleagues. Implications for gender theory, emotional labor, and nursing policy and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

After defining warmth/communion and competence/agency, the chapter integrates converging work documenting the centrality of these dimensions in interpersonal as well as intergroup perception. Structural origins of warmth and competence perceptions result from competitors judged as not warm, and allies judged as warm; high status confers competence and low status incompetence. Warmth and competence judgments support systematic patterns of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions, including ambivalent prejudices. Past views of prejudice as a univalent antipathy have obscured the unique responses toward groups stereotyped as competent but not warm or warm but not competent. Finally, the chapter addresses unresolved issues and future research directions.},

Attrition from nursing programmes and retention of nurses in the profession are international concerns and steps are currently being taken in the United Kingdom to tackle these issues. Aim. The aim of this study was to investigate prospectively the determinants of, and relationships among, stress, burnout and attrition in nursing students.
Method. A longitudinal design involving a complete cohort of nursing students was employed, using a battery of instruments to measure personality, intelligence, psychological morbidity, stress, coping and burnout. Data were gathered on entry, at12 and 24 months, and at the end of the nursing programme. Findings. Students experienced increasing levels of stress and use of negative coping mechanisms as the programme progressed and psychological morbidity increased. Positive aspects of personality were more likely to lead to aspects of burnout, and personality was a more important indicator of attrition than cognitive ability.
Conclusions. Stress, burnout and attrition may not be directly linked. Personality factors at course entry contributed significantly to the prediction of burnout and programme completion, but the relationships were not strong enough to be practically useful.},

When actively choosing hospitals, consumers can compare data on the quality of hospital performance among providers. However, patients do not necessarily take full advantage of comparative quality information but instead use a number of readily available proxies to evaluate provider trustworthiness. According to the stereotypic content model, organizational trustworthiness is built on stereotypical perceptions of hospitals' competence and warmth, reflected by visible hospital characteristics such as ownership and teaching status, and size. We introduce a theoretical framework on stereotypic quality perceptions that brings together fragmented findings in health services research on patient quality expectations of hospital characteristics. The model provides a basis for further research and recommendations for improved hospital communication strategies. The study suggests that researchers as well as hospital management should pay more attention to stereotypical patient quality perceptions and their impact on hospital choice to understand patients' quality evaluations better.},

        BACKGROUND:~Women receive more negative feedback and evaluations than men\textemdash{}from both sexes. Some suggest that, to be successful in traditionally male roles such as surgeon, women must manifest a warmth-related (communal) rather than competence-related (agentic) demeanor. Compared with male residents, female residents experience more interpersonal difficulties and less help from female nurses. We examined feedback provided to residents by female nurses.
        METHODS:~We examined Professional Associate Questionnaires (2006\textendash{}2014) using a mixed-methods design. We compared scores per training year by gender using Mann-Whitney and linear regression adjusting for resident and nurse cohorts. Using grounded theory analysis, we developed a coding system for blinded comments based on principles of effective feedback, medical learners' evaluation, and impression management. {$\chi$}2 examined the proportions of negative and positive and communal and agentic comments between genders.
        RESULTS:~We examined 2,202 evaluations: 397 (18\%) for 10 men and 1,805 (82\%) for 34 women. Twenty-three compliments (eg, ``Great resident!'') were excluded. Evaluations per training year varied: men n=77\textendash{}134; women n=384\textendash{}482. Postgraduate year (PGY)-1, PGY-2, and PGY-4 women had lower mean ratings (P{$<$}.035); when adjusted, the difference remained significant in PGY-2 (MWomen=1.5{$\pm$}0.6 compared with MMen=1.7{$\pm$}0.5; P=.001). Postgraduate year-1 women received disproportionately fewer positive and more negative agentic comments than PGY-1 men (positive=17.3\% compared with 40\%, negative=17.3\% compared with 3.3\%, respectively; P=.041).

Background The number of nurses enrolled in a nurse prescribing programme is rapidly increasing in Finland. However, few studies on nurse prescribing education are available and therefore research is needed, particularly from the point of view of nurses studying in the programme. Design The descriptive, qualitative study used the text of student online learning diaries as data during a 14-month prescribing programme. The sample consisted of 31 nurses, public health nurses or midwives enrolled in a prescribing programme at a university of applied sciences. The data were analysed using the inductive analysis method. Results The growth of nurses' prescribing competence was facilitated by learning clinical examination of the patient, networking with peers, receiving support from the workplace and supervisors, doctors' positive attitude towards nurse prescribing and being able to apply competencies directly to nursing practice. The barriers to the growth of nurses' prescribing competence were unclear job description, incomplete care plans and concerns about how consultation with doctors will be organised and realised. Conclusions The results show that, for the purpose of developing the new role and position of nurse prescribers, educators and nursing managers must invest more in staff awareness of nurse prescribing education and also offer more support to nurse prescribers in their workplaces. Relevance to clinical practice The results of this study can be used especially in countries where nurse prescribing education is only in the process of being planned or has just been started. Heads of nursing and educators in prescribing education will benefit from the results when creating expanded job descriptions for nurses and supporting networking between students during the period of training.},

Extraversion was associated with positive health behaviours. Openness to experience and agreeableness were associated with positive health perceptions. There were some striking differences between associations found within the male and female groups. Agreeable women reported fewer medical problems and less frequent visits to the GP than antagonistic women, whereas conscientious men reported more positive health perceptions and more visits to the GP than non-conscientious men. Conclusion. Since associations are evident for each of the personality traits, all of the `big five' personality traits should be included in research on health behaviour to investigate their relevance for clinical practice.},

The results indicated significant differences between professional (BSN) and technical (AD and diploma) nurses on measures of nurse performance. Measures resulting in larger effects for professional nurses included communication skills, knowledge, problem-solving, and professional role. No differences resulted from studies of nurses from the two technical programs, AD and diploma. Further analyses indicated that the effects could not be solely attributed to substantive and methodological features of the studies. However, the hospital setting where a study was conducted and years of nursing experience decreased the size of the effect. The results of the meta-analysis have implications for policy development about educational preparation and for service expectations of professional and technical nurses.},

  abstract = {In medicine, it is critical that clinicians demonstrate both empathy (perceived as warmth) and competence. Perceptions of these qualities are often intuitive and are based on nonverbal behavior. Emphasizing both warmth and competence may prove problematic, however, because there is evidence that they are inversely related in other settings. We hypothesize that perceptions of physician competence will instead be positively correlated with perceptions of physician warmth and empathy, potentially due to changing conceptions of the physician's role. We test this hypothesis in an analog medical context using a large online sample, manipulating physician nonverbal behaviors suggested to communicate empathy (e.g. eye contact) and competence (the physician's white coat). Participants rated physicians displaying empathic nonverbal behavior as more empathic, warm, and more competent than physicians displaying unempathic nonverbal behavior, adjusting for mood. We found no warmth/competence tradeoff and, additionally, no significant effects of the white coat. Further, compared with male participants, female participants perceived physicians displaying unempathic nonverbal behavior as less empathic. Given the significant consequences of clinician empathy, it is important for clinicians to learn how nonverbal behavior contributes to perceptions of warmth, and use it as another tool to improve their patients' emotional and physical health.},

A questionnaire including measures of gender role identity and perceived gender appropriateness of careers was administered to 384 students early in the first year of the course. At the end of the programme attrition rates were obtained. The findings indicate that males were more likely to leave the course than females. Furthermore, those who completed the course tended to view nursing as more appropriate for women, in contrast to the non-completers who had less gender typed views. The female-dominated nature of nursing, prevalent stereotypes and gender bias inherent in nursing education seem to make this an uncomfortable place for males and those with less gendered typed views. Whilst it is acknowledged that attrition is undoubtedly a complex issue with many contributing factors, the nursing profession need to take steps to address this bias to ensure their profession is open equally to both female and male recruits.},

  abstract = {Background
Nurses are often portrayed as possessing specific traits and dispositions associated with care and empathy. The assumption has been that possessing these traits makes nurses competent, engaged, and well suited to their job. This proposition has been mostly normative, and few studies have investigated how this plays out empirically.
Objective
The aims of this study were to investigate (a) whether possessing a personality trait related to empathy and care was more common among nursing students than students in teaching and social work programs and (b) whether nursing students possessing an affirming personality trait judged themselves to be more suited to their future work \textendash{} understood as commitment to the profession \textendash{} than students in teaching and social work.
Design
A cross-sectional survey design was used.
Participants and setting
All first-year students attending seven Norwegian universities and university colleges were invited to participate in the study. Of the 1675 students who participated in the survey, 527 were nursing students, 668 were students in teaching, and 480 were social work students. A response rate of 65 percent was achieved.
Methods
The survey was conducted by Oslo and Akershus University College in the autumn of 2012. Data collection methods included both a paper-and-pencil questionnaire and an online survey. Instruments used included Blau's Career Commitment Scale and Orlinsky and R{\o}nnestad's Interpersonal Adjective Scale. Analysis of variance and regression analysis were performed on the data.
Results
Nursing students did not differ from students in teaching and social work programs in terms of the degree of affirming personality trait. Furthermore, the regression analysis revealed an equally strong association between having an affirming personality trait and being committed to the profession among all these student groups.
Conclusion
The results of this study indicate that the narrative of nursing students as individuals who possess a special personality characteristic does not entirely reflect reality.},

The need for this shift in focus has become particularly urgent with respect to chronic conditions; primary care, including care coordination and transitional care; prevention and wellness; and the prevention of adverse events, such as hospital-acquired infections. Given the aging population, moreover, the need for long-term and palliative care will continue to grow in the coming years (see Chapter 2). The increase in the insured population and the rapid increase in racial and ethnic minority groups who have traditionally faced obstacles in accessing health care will also demand that care be designed for a more socioeconomically and culturally diverse population.},

  abstract = {Objective
There is a growing amount of empirical research on empathy in medicine. This critical review assesses methodological limitations in this body of research that have not received adequate attention.
Methods
Scientific publications presenting empirical research on medical students' or physicians' empathy were systematically searched for.
Results
206 publications were identified and critically reviewed. Multiple empirical approaches have been used. However, there are some remarkable tendencies given the complexity of the study object: empathy is often not defined. Qualitative approaches are rarely used and the predominant quantitative instruments have a relatively narrow or peripheral scope. For example, the concrete experiences, feelings, and interpretations of the physician and the patient, and empathy in clinical practice, are often neglected. Furthermore, possible influences of medical training and working conditions on empathy have not been adequately explored.
Conclusion
The empirical studies of empathy in medicine tend to separate empathy from main parts of clinical perception, judgment, and communication. Thus, important aspects and influences of empathy have been relatively neglected.
Practice implications
Future studies should include transparent concepts, more than one method and perspective, qualitative approaches, the physician's and the patient's concrete experiences and interpretations, and the context in which empathy is developed and practiced.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Nurse-physician stereotypes have been proposed as a factor hindering interprofessional collaboration among practitioners and interprofessional learning among nursing and medical students. Using socio-psychological theories about ambivalent stereotypes, the present work aimed to analyse: a) the content of nurse and physician stereotypes held by nursing and medical students and b) the role of auto-stereotype on students' attitude toward interprofessional education (IPE).~ Methods. A cross-sectional on-line survey was adopted and a questionnaire was emailed to 205 nursing students and 151 medical students attending an Italian university.
RESULTS: Nursing and medical students shared the stereotypical belief that nurses are warmer but less competent than physicians. Nurses and physicians were basically depicted with ambivalent stereotypes: nurses were seen as communal, socially competent and caring but less competent, not agentic and less autonomous, while physicians were seen as agentic, competent and autonomous, but less communal, less collectivist and less socially competent. Moreover, a professional stereotypical image impacted the students' attitude toward IPE. More precisely, when nurses and physicians were seen with classic ambivalent stereotypes, both nursing and medical students were less favourable towards interprofessional education programmes.
CONCLUSIONS: The content of professional stereotypes of healthcare students was still linked to classical views of nurses as caring and physicians as curing. This seemed to limit students' attitude and intention to be engaged in IPE.},

  abstract = {Aims and objectives The aim of this study was to test the adequacy of the Competence-Turnover Intention Model, which was developed to identify how nursing competence could affect nurses' turnover intention (nurses' intention to voluntarily leave an organisation). Background Recent studies have suggested that the level of nursing competence is negatively related to nurses' intention to leave their jobs, suggesting that a lack of competence threatens both the quality and quantity of the nursing workforce. However, the mechanism of how nursing competence affects nurses' turnover intention has not been explored previously. Design A cross-sectional survey design was used. Methods Surveys were distributed to 1337 Japanese registered nurses/midwives in October, 2013. The adequacy of the model was analysed using structural equation modelling. Results In total, 766 questionnaires were returned, with a return rate of 57\%. The model fitted well with the data. The results showed that the level of nursing competence was related positively to the quantity of organisational rewards they felt they had received, and negatively related to the level of exhaustion they experienced. Moreover, the perceived organisational rewards and exhaustion were correlated with nurses' turnover intention through affective commitment. Conclusions The Competence-Turnover Intention Model is useful for explaining how nursing competence impacts on their turnover intention. Relevance to clinical practice Clinical implications derived from the findings are that: promoting nursing competence is key to improving not only the quality of care provided by nurses, but also to retaining the nursing workforce, and the model can be used to develop strategies that would mitigate their turnover intention.},

An important component of these theories is understanding an individual's motivation to choose a certain profession. This preliminary study examined gender differences in motivations to enter the field of nursing. Two theoretical points of view were offered to account for the differences: Holland and Row's models of person-job congruence and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. One hundred and sixty (24 men and 136 women) freshmen from 3 nursing programs were asked to report their motivations to enter nursing. A new instrument based on the models mentioned above and representing 2 basic motivations, self-actualization and survival needs, was developed for the purposes of this study. While both genders mentioned self-actualization as their main motivation for entering nursing, men tended to give survival needs more weight than women did. The motivation patterns as well as the gender differences are discussed in light of recent trends in nursing and within the framework of personnel selection and training.},
