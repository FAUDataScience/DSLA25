THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE METHODS AND THEIR RELATION TO CONVENTIONAL METHODOLOGY AND STATISTICS. COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE HAS THREE IMPORTANT FEATURES. FIRSTLY, IT OFTEN INVOLVES BIG DATA; DATA SETS SO LARGE THAT CONVENTIONAL DATABASE AND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES CANNOT HANDLE THEM WITH EASE. SECONDLY, DEALING WITH THESE BIG DATA SETS HAS GIVEN RISE TO ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES THAT ARE SPECIALLY DEVELOPED FOR BIG DATA. GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE DATA, RESAMPLING AND CROSS-VALIDATION APPROACHES BECOME FEASIBLE THAT ALLOW BOTH DATA-DRIVEN EXPLORATION AND CHECKS ON OVERFITTING THE DATA. A THIRD IMPORTANT FEATURE IS SIMULATION, ESPECIALLY AGENT-BASED SIMULATION. HERE SIZE ALSO MATTERS. AGENT-BASED SIMULATION IS WELL KNOWN IN SOCIAL SCIENCE, BUT MODERN COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE ALLOWS SIMULATIONS OF UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. MANY OF THESE TECHNIQUES, ESPECIALLY THE RESAMPLING AND CROSS-VALIDATION APPROACHES, ARE POTENTIALLY VERY USEFUL FOR SOCIAL SCIENTISTS. GIVEN THE RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE ""BIG DATA"" IS USEFUL TO EXPLORE HOW WELL THESE TECHNIQUES PERFORM WITH SMALLER DATA SETS. SOCIAL SCIENCE METHODOLOGY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THIS FIELD BY EXPLORING IF WELL-KNOWN METHODOLOGICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN EXTERNAL VALIDITY, INTERNAL VALIDITY, AND CONSTRUCT VALIDITY CAN HELP CLEAR UP DISCUSSIONS ON DATA QUALITY (VERACITY) IN COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE.

MUCH RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD IS FOUNDED ON THE PREMISE THAT SOCIETY IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM WITH EMERGENT STRUCTURES THAT CAN BE MODELED OR RECONSTRUCTED THROUGH DIGITAL DATA. THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE SERVES PRACTICAL AND LEGITIMIZING FUNCTIONS FOR DIGITAL CAPITALISM IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMICS DOES FOR NEOLIBERALISM. IN RECOGNITION OF THIS HOMOLOGY, THIS PAPER DEVELOPS A CRITIQUE OF THE COMPLEXITY PERSPECTIVE OF COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE AND ARGUES FOR A HETERODOX COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FOUNDED ON THE META-THEORY OF CRITICAL REALISM THAT IS CRITICAL, METHODOLOGICAL PLURALIST, INTERPRETATIVE AND EXPLANATIVE. THIS IMPLIES DIVERTING COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE' COMPUTATIONAL METHODS AND DIGITAL DATA SO AS TO NOT BE AIMED AT IDENTIFYING INVARIANT LAWS OF SOCIAL LIFE, OR OPTIMIZING STATE AND CORPORATE PRACTICES, BUT TO INSTEAD BE USED AS PART OF BROADER RESEARCH STRATEGIES TO IDENTIFY CONTINGENT PATTERNS, DEVELOP CONJUNCTURAL EXPLANATIONS, AND PROPOSE QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT WAYS OF ORGANIZING SOCIAL LIFE.

THE COMPLEXITY OF RESEARCH TOPICS IN SOCIAL SCIENCE MAKES IT THE AMALGAMATION OF MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES, SUCH AS ECONOMICS, POLITICAL SCIENCE, AND SOCIOLOGY, ETC. FOR CENTURIES, SCIENTISTS HAVE CONDUCTED MANY STUDIES TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS OF THE SOCIETY. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL RESEARCH METHODS, THERE EXIST MANY CRITICAL SOCIAL ISSUES TO BE EXPLORED. TO SOLVE THOSE ISSUES, COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE EMERGES DUE TO THE RAPID ADVANCEMENTS OF COMPUTATION TECHNOLOGIES AND THE PROFOUND STUDIES ON SOCIAL SCIENCE. WITH THE AIDS OF THE ADVANCED RESEARCH TECHNIQUES, VARIOUS KINDS OF DATA FROM DIVERSE AREAS CAN BE ACQUIRED NOWADAYS, AND THEY CAN HELP US LOOK INTO SOCIAL PROBLEMS WITH A NEW EYE. AS A RESULT, UTILIZING VARIOUS DATA TO REVEAL ISSUES DERIVED FROM COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE AREA HAS ATTRACTED MORE AND MORE ATTENTIONS. IN THIS PAPER, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, WE PRESENT A SURVEY ON DATADRIVEN COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME WHICH PRIMARILY FOCUSES ON REVIEWING APPLICATION DOMAINS INVOLVING HUMAN DYNAMICS. THE STATE-OF-THE-ART RESEARCH ON HUMAN DYNAMICS IS REVIEWED FROM THREE ASPECTS: INDIVIDUALS, RELATIONSHIPS, AND COLLECTIVES. SPECIFICALLY, THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES USED TO ADDRESS RESEARCH CHALLENGES IN AFOREMENTIONED APPLICATION DOMAINS ARE SUMMARIZED. IN ADDITION, SOME IMPORTANT OPEN CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO BOTH EMERGING RESEARCH TOPICS AND RESEARCH METHODS ARE DISCUSSED. (C) 2020 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES AN INTEGRATIVE LEARNING MODEL FOR TEACHING COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE SKILLS TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. THERE ARE THREE ELEMENTS TO THE MODEL: CONTENT DELIVERY THROUGH COLLABORATIVE LEARNING, SKILL DEVELOPMENT IN AN APPLIED LAB SETTING, AND STUDENT MENTORSHIP. I APPLY THIS MODEL TO AN EXPERIENTIAL COURSE WHERE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS LEARN TO CREATE AND CONDUCT A NATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION POLL. THE MODEL ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR UNIVERSITY CLASSES THAT EQUIP UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE SKILLS, AND PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR TRAINING STUDENT RESEARCHERS AS TEACHING ASSISTANTS FOR FUTURE COURSES. THIS MODEL BUILDS THE RESEARCH CAPACITY OF FACULTY, GRADUATE ASSISTANTS, AND UNDERGRADUATES, INVESTS IN DATA SCIENCE BY PROVIDING AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE COLLECTION OF LARGE SCALE DATA OVER TIME, AND INTEGRATES EXPERIENCES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM.

WITH THE EMERGENCE OF NEW DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES, ADVANCED DATA MINING AND ANALYTICS SUPPORT, THERE SEEMS TO BE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES THAT ARE OCCURRING WITH THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS WE CAN ASK, AND THE RESEARCH METHODS WE CAN APPLY. THE CONTEXTS INCLUDE SOCIAL NETWORKS AND BLOGS, POLITICAL DISCOURSE, CORPORATE ANNOUNCEMENTS, DIGITAL JOURNALISM, MOBILE TELEPHONY, HOME ENTERTAINMENT, ONLINE GAMING, FINANCIAL SERVICES, ONLINE SHOPPING, SOCIAL ADVERTISING, AND SOCIAL COMMERCE. THE CHANGING COSTS OF DATA COLLECTION AND THE NEW CAPABILITIES THAT RESEARCHERS HAVE TO CONDUCT RESEARCH THAT LEVERAGES MICRO-LEVEL, MESO-LEVEL AND MACRO-LEVEL DATA SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY OF A SCIENTIFIC PARADIGM SHIFT TOWARD COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE. THE NEW THINKING RELATED TO EMPIRICAL REGULARITIES ANALYSIS, EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, AND LONGITUDINAL EMPIRICAL RESEARCH FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT THESE APPROACHES CAN BE TAILORED FOR RAPID ACQUISITION OF BIG DATA SETS. THIS WILL ALLOW BUSINESS ANALYSTS AND RESEARCHERS TO ACHIEVE FREQUENT, CONTROLLED AND MEANINGFUL OBSERVATIONS OF REAL-WORLD PHENOMENA.

INFORMATION FLOWS ARE ALWAYS INVOLVED IN SYSTEMS OF INTERDEPENDENT CITIES. THIS IS THE REASON WHY GEORGE ZIPF AND ALLAN PRED, BOTH PIONEERS OF THE URBAN SYSTEMS LITERATURE, WERE EAGER TO OBTAIN DATA ON THESE RELATIONS TO UNDERSTAND URBAN SYSTEM DYNAMICS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF LIMITED RESOURCES IN DATA ACQUISITION, THEY RESTRICTED THEIR STUDIES TO SMALL SAMPLES OF CITIES OR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. BY USING NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE TECHNIQUES ON A DIGITAL ARCHIVE OF HISTORICAL NEWSPAPERS, WE COULD MAP AND EXPLORE CHANGES IN THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF NEWS COVERAGE IN THE NETHERLANDS AT AN UNPRECEDENTED DETAILED SCALE FOR A PERIOD OF 62 YEARS. IN THIS PAPER, WE ANALYSE 24 MILLION NEWS ITEMS MENTIONING 312 DIFFERENT CITIES AND TOWNS IN A SAMPLE OF 31 LOCAL NEWSPAPERS. THANKS TO THIS DATA, WE WERE ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT THE INFORMATION FIELD OF URBAN READERSHIPS FROM DIFFERENT CITIES AND HOW IT CHANGED OVER TIME. BY ANALYSING THEIR EVOLUTION, WE FIND EVIDENCE OF SPACE-TIME CONTRACTION WITH AN INCREASING COVERAGE OF FARAWAY PLACES IN THE PERIOD RANGING FROM 1869 TO 1930. HOWEVER, THIS COVERAGE IS NOT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED BUT IS CHARACTERIZED BY A HIERARCHICAL SELECTION PROCESS. COVERAGE OF THE LARGEST CITIES IN THE RANDSTAD INCREASED AT THE EXPENSE OF INFORMATION FLOWS FROM INTERMEDIATE PROVINCIAL CITIES.

THIS LARGE-SCALE, LONG-TERM EXPERIMENT OF IN SILICO SOCIAL SCIENCE, ABOUT WHICH THE GROUND TRUTH OF SIMULATED WORLDS WAS KNOWN, BUT NOT BY US, REVEALS THE LIMITS OF CONTEMPORARY QUANTITATIVE SOCIAL SCIENCE METHODOLOGY. FIRST, PROBLEM SOLVING WITHOUT A SHARED ONTOLOGY-IN WHICH MANY WORLD CHARACTERISTICS REMAIN EXISTENTIALLY UNCERTAIN-POSES STRONG LIMITS TO QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS EVEN WHEN SCIENTISTS SHARE A COMMON TASK, AND SUGGESTS HOW THEY COULD BECOME INSURMOUNTABLE WITHOUT IT. SECOND, DATA LABELS BIASED THE ASSOCIATIONS OUR ANALYSTS MADE AND ASSUMPTIONS THEY EMPLOYED, OFTEN AWAY FROM THE SIMULATED CAUSAL PROCESSES THOSE LABELS SIGNIFIED, SUGGESTING LIMITS ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH ANALYTIC CONCEPTS DEVELOPED IN ONE DOMAIN MAY PORT TO OTHERS. THIRD, THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE PUBLICATION IS A DEMONSTRATION OF NOVEL CAUSES, BUT THIS LIMITS THE RELEVANCE OF MODELS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND PROPOSE POLICIES THAT BENEFIT FROM THE SIMPLER AND LESS SURPRISING ANSWERS ASSOCIATED WITH MOST IMPORTANT CAUSES, OR THE COMBINATION OF ALL CAUSES. FOURTH, MOST SINGULAR QUANTITATIVE METHODS APPLIED ON THEIR OWN DID NOT HELP TO SOLVE MOST ANALYTICAL CHALLENGES, AND WE EXPLORED A RANGE OF ESTABLISHED AND EMERGING METHODS, INCLUDING PROBABILISTIC PROGRAMMING, DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS, SYSTEMS OF PREDICTIVE PROBABILISTIC FINITE STATE MACHINES, AND MORE TO ACHIEVE PLAUSIBLE SOLUTIONS. HOWEVER, DESPITE THESE LIMITATIONS COMMON TO THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE, WE FIND ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THAT EVEN IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE CAN BE SUFFICIENT TO IDENTIFY ROBUST PREDICTION IF A MORE PLURALISTIC APPROACH IS APPLIED. APPLYING COMPETING APPROACHES BY DISTINCT SUBTEAMS, INCLUDING AT ONE POINT THE VAST TOPCODER.COM GLOBAL COMMUNITY OF PROBLEM SOLVERS, ENABLED DISCOVERY OF MANY ASPECTS OF THE RELEVANT STRUCTURE UNDERLYING WORLDS THAT SINGULAR METHODS COULD NOT. TOGETHER, THESE LESSONS SUGGEST HOW DIFFERENT A POLICY-ORIENTED COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE WOULD BE THAN THE COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE WE HAVE INHERITED.

ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS (OSNS) CAN BE USED FOR NOBLE CAUSES BY BRINGING TOGETHER COMMUNITIES WITH COMMON SHARED INTERESTS AND TO PROMOTE AWARENESS OF VARIOUS CAUSES. HOWEVER, THERE IS A DARK SIDE TO THE USE OF OSNS. OSNS CAN ALSO BE USED AS A COORDINATION AND AMPLIFICATION PLATFORM FOR ATTACKS. FOR INSTANCE, ADVERSARIES CAN INCREASE THE IMPACT OF AN ATTACK BY CAUSING PANIC IN AN AREA BY PROMOTING ATTACKS USING OSNS. PUBLIC DATA CAN HELP ADVERSARIES TO DETERMINE THE BEST TIMING FOR ATTACKS, SCHEDULING ATTACKS, AND THEN USING OSNS TO COORDINATE ATTACKS ON NETWORKS OR PHYSICAL LOCATIONS. THIS CONVERGENCE OF THE CYBER AND PHYSICAL WORLDS IS KNOWN AS CYBERNETICS.

RESPONDENTS WERE RESURVEYED AT THE END OF THE MONTH TO MEASURE THE EFFECT OF THIS TREATMENT, AND AT REGULAR INTERVALS THROUGHOUT THE STUDY PERIOD TO MONITOR TREATMENT COMPLIANCE. WE FIND THAT REPUBLICANS WHO FOLLOWED A LIBERAL TWITTER BOT BECAME SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CONSERVATIVE POSTTREATMENT. DEMOCRATS EXHIBITED SLIGHT INCREASES IN LIBERAL ATTITUDES AFTER FOLLOWING A CONSERVATIVE TWITTER BOT, ALTHOUGH THESE EFFECTS ARE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. NOTWITHSTANDING IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS OF OUR STUDY, THESE FINDINGS HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE INTERDISCIPLINARY LITERATURE ON POLITICAL POLARIZATION AND THE EMERGING FIELD OF COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE.

PARTIES, HOWEVER, STRATEGICALLY CONTROL PUBLIC DISCUSSION BY EMPHASISING TOPICS THAT THEY BELIEVE WILL HIGHLIGHT THEIR STRENGTHS IN VOTERS' MINDS. POLITICAL STRATEGY HAS BEEN STUDIED FOR DECADES, MOSTLY BY MANUALLY ANNOTATING AND ANALYSING PARTY STATEMENTS, PRESS COVERAGE, OR TV ADS. HERE WE BUILD ON RECENT WORK IN THE AREAS OF COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE AND EDEMOCRACY, WHICH STUDIED THESE CONCEPTS COMPUTATIONALLY WITH SOCIAL MEDIA. WE OPERATIONALIZE ISSUE ENGAGEMENT AND RELATED POLITICAL SCIENCE THEORIES TO MEASURE AND QUANTIFY POLITICIANS' COMMUNICATION BEHAVIOR USING MORE THAN 366K TWEETS POSTED BY OVER 1,000 PROMINENT GERMAN POLITICIANS IN THE 2017 ELECTION YEAR. TO THIS END, WE FIRST IDENTIFY ISSUES IN POSTED TWEETS BY UTILISING A HASHTAG-BASED APPROACH WELL KNOWN IN THE LITERATURE. THIS METHOD ALLOWS SEVERAL PROMINENT ISSUES FEATURING IN THE POLITICAL DEBATE ON TWITTER THAT YEAR TO BE IDENTIFIED. WE SHOW THAT DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES ENGAGE TO A LARGER OR LESSER EXTENT WITH THESE ISSUES. THE FINDINGS REVEAL DIFFERING SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGIES BY PARTIES LOCATED AT DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE POLITICAL LEFT-RIGHT SCALE, IN TERMS OF WHICH ISSUES THEY ENGAGE WITH, HOW CONFRONTATIONAL THEY ARE AND HOW THEIR STRATEGIES EVOLVE IN THE LEAD-UP TO THE ELECTION.

IN PARTICULAR, THE PAGES OF A SET OF HISTORICALLY NOTABLE INDIVIDUALS ARE PROCESSED TO CATCH THE LOCATIONS AND THE DATE OF PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS. THIS INFORMATION IS THEN STRUCTURED IN A GEOGRAPHICAL NETWORK OF MOBILITY PATTERNS. WE ANALYZE THE MOBILITY OF HISTORICALLY NOTABLE INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF MIGRATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF INNOVATION AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS WORK, WE FIRST PRESENT SOME GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DATASET FROM A SOCIAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL PERSPECTIVE. THEN, WE BUILD A SPATIAL NETWORK OF CITIES, AND WE MODEL AND QUANTIFY THE TENDENCY TO EXPLORE OF A SET OF PEOPLE THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED AS HISTORICALLY AND CULTURALLY NOTABLE. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, WE SHOW THAT BY USING A MULTILEVEL RADIATION MODEL FOR HUMAN MOBILITY, WE ARE ABLE TO CATCH IMPORTANT FEATURES OF MIGRATION'S BEHAVIOR. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CHOICE OF THE TARGET MIGRATION PLACE FOR HISTORICALLY AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT PEOPLE IS LIMITED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF LOCATIONS AND THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE DISCIPLINE A NOTABLE IS INTERESTED IN AND ON THE NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES SHE/HE CAN FIND THERE.

OUR APPROACH COMBINES PREPROCESSING BY LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA) WITH MODEL TREES. LDA IS USED TO PROCESS THE NATURAL LANGUAGE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EACH REPORT SUMMARY BY ESTIMATING LATENT TOPICS AND ASSIGNING EACH REPORT TO ONE OF THEM. TOGETHER WITH OTHER VARIABLES THESE TOPIC ASSIGNMENTS SERVE AS SPLITTING VARIABLES FOR FINDING SEGMENTS IN THE DATA TO WHICH LOCAL STATISTICAL MODELS FOR THE REPORTED NUMBER OF FATALITIES ARE FITTED. SEGMENTATION AND FITTING IS CARRIED OUT WITH RECURSIVE PARTITIONING OF NEGATIVE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTIONS.

USING PRINCIPLES OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS, WE QUANTIFY CHANGES IN VALENCE AND AROUSAL THROUGH SUBJECTIVE REPORTS, AS RECORDED IN THREE INDEPENDENT STUDIES INCLUDING 207 PARTICIPANTS (110 FEMALE). IN THE CONTEXT OF ONLINE DISCUSSIONS, THE DYNAMICS OF VALENCE AND AROUSAL IS COMPOSED OF TWO FORCES: AN INTERNAL RELAXATION TOWARDS BASELINE VALUES INDEPENDENT OF THE EMOTIONAL CHARGE OF THE DISCUSSION AND A DRIVING FORCE OF EMOTIONAL STATES THAT DEPENDS ON THE CONTENT OF THE DISCUSSION. THE DYNAMICS OF VALENCE SHOW THE EXISTENCE OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE TENDENCIES, WHILE AROUSAL INCREASES WHEN READING EMOTIONAL CONTENT REGARDLESS OF ITS POLARITY. THE TENDENCY OF PARTICIPANTS TO TAKE PART IN THE DISCUSSION INCREASES WITH POSITIVE AROUSAL. WHEN PARTICIPATING IN AN ONLINE DISCUSSION, THE CONTENT OF PARTICIPANTS' EXPRESSION DEPENDS ON THEIR VALENCE, AND THEIR AROUSAL SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES AFTERWARDS AS A REGULATION MECHANISM. WE ILLUSTRATE HOW THESE RESULTS ALLOW THE DESIGN OF AGENT-BASED MODELS TO REPRODUCE AND ANALYSE EMOTIONS IN ONLINE COMMUNITIES.

THE CURRENT STUDY LEVERAGES A DATABASE OF OVER 600,000 REQUESTS FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICES RECEIVED BY THE CITY OF BOSTON, MA'S 311 SYSTEM AS A WAY TO ANSWER SUCH QUESTIONS, FOCUSING PARTICULARLY ON REPORTS OF ISSUES IN THE PUBLIC SPACE ARISING FROM INCIVILITIES. IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH CONSTRUCT VALIDITY FOR THE ""BIG DATA"" OF THE 311 SYSTEM, THEY ARE COMBINED WITH THE ""SMALL DATA"" OF A SURVEY OF 311 USERS, PERMITTING THE SIMULTANEOUS ANALYSIS OF OBJECTIVE REPORTING BEHAVIORS WITH SELF-REPORT ATTITUDES. THE ANALYSIS OCCURS IN TWO PARTS. FIRST, REPORTING OF INCIVILITIES IS DISTINGUISHED BEHAVIORALLY FROM REPORTING PUBLIC ISSUES ARISING FROM NATURAL DETERIORATION, AND PEOPLE ARE FOUND TO SPECIALIZE IN ONE OR THE OTHER. SECOND, THE SURVEY IS USED TO TEST WHETHER THE REPORTS ARE A REFLECTION OF TERRITORIALITY. REPORTS OF INCIVILITIES WERE UNIQUE IN THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH A DESIRE TO ENFORCE LOCAL SOCIAL NORMS. THEY WERE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH A SECOND TERRITORIAL MOTIVATION TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY. IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ARE DISCUSSED. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

AT FIRST, WE FOUND THE EXPONENTIAL PROLIFERATION OF AWARDS ACROSS ALL GENRES OF FILMS AND ALL PROFESSIONS OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS IN CAREERS ACROSS TIME. MORE THAN 30% OF THE PERFORMERS HAVE WON MULTIPLE AWARDS. SECOND, WE BUILT AN AWARD NETWORK TO REVEAL THE INTERLOCKS BETWEEN AWARDS BASED ON MULTIPLE AWARD-WINNING PHENOMENA. WE FOUND THAT FOR PRESTIGIOUS AWARDS, 47% OF THE LINKAGES WERE OVER-REPRESENTATIVE THAN THE EXPECTATIONS FROM THE NULL MODEL. FURTHERMORE, THE PERFORMERS' COLLABORATION NETWORK WAS HIGHLY CLUSTERED, EXHIBITING A HIGH PROPENSITY OF LINKAGES BETWEEN AWARDED PERFORMERS. LASTLY, OUR REGRESSION MODELS REVEALED THAT MULTIPLE FACTORS WERE RELATED TO PERFORMERS' EARLY CAREER SUCCESS AND AWARD WINNING. SPECIFICALLY, WE SHOWED THAT ALONG WITH THE PERFORMERS' HISTORICAL ACHIEVEMENTS, THEIR COLLABORATORS SERVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN AWARD WINNING AFTER BEING NOMINATED, WITH THE SCOPE AND DEPTH OF THE IMPACT DIFFERING IN THE AWARDS' PRESTIGE. THIS WORK HAS STRONG IMPLICATIONS FOR THE HARMONIOUS DYNAMICS OF THE MOVIE INDUSTRY AND THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT OF PERFORMERS.

FOR EXAMPLE, 64.1% OF PRIZEWINNERS HAVE WON TWO PRIZES AND 13.7% HAVE WON FIVE OR MORE PRIZES. SECOND, CERTAIN PRIZES STRONGLY INTERLOCK DISCIPLINES AND SUBDISCIPLINES, CREATING KEY PATHWAYS BY WHICH KNOWLEDGE SPREADS AND IS RECOGNIZED ACROSS SCIENCE.

HERE WE PERFORM A SET OF SIMPLE IN SILICO EXPERIMENTS IN TWO SPACE DIMENSIONS WHERE DIFFERENT GROUP OF DOMAINS (CIVILIZATIONS) EACH OF DIFFERENT SIZES ARE ALLOWED TO EVOLVE THROUGH INTERACTIONS (WARS) AND COALESCENCES FROM THEIR INITIAL RANDOM DISTRIBUTION. AS THEY GROW IN SIZE, DOMAINS OF SIMILAR GROUP UNDERGO COALESCENCE WHEN THEY MEET WHILE DOMAINS BELONGING TO DIFFERENT GROUP ENGAGE IN WARFARE AT THE POINT OF INTERACTION. DURING A WARFARE, THE SMALLER DOMAIN IS ANNIHILATED AND THE LARGER DOMAIN SHRINKS IN SIZE DEPENDING UPON THE FAIRNESS OF THE WAR. AS A RESULT, WE OBTAIN VARYING DECAY RATE AND AGE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF CIVILIZATIONS UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND THEY ARE FOUND TO DEPEND ON THE FAIRNESS OF WAR, INITIAL DISTRIBUTIONS, NUMBER OF DISTINCT GROUPS, AND INITIAL NUMBER DENSITY. WE ALSO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF WAR IN THE PRESENCE OF POWERFUL CIVILIZATIONS THAT NEVER RETREATS IN A WAR.

WE USED DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS TO EXTRACT FEATURES FROM 35,326 FACIAL IMAGES. THESE FEATURES WERE ENTERED INTO A LOGISTIC REGRESSION AIMED AT CLASSIFYING SEXUAL ORIENTATION. GIVEN A SINGLE FACIAL IMAGE, A CLASSIFIER COULD CORRECTLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GAY AND HETEROSEXUAL MEN IN 81% OF CASES, AND IN 71% OF CASES FOR WOMEN. HUMAN JUDGES ACHIEVED MUCH LOWER ACCURACY: 61% FOR MEN AND 54% FOR WOMEN. THE ACCURACY OF THE ALGORITHM INCREASED TO 91% AND 83%, RESPECTIVELY, GIVEN FIVE FACIAL IMAGES PER PERSON. FACIAL FEATURES EMPLOYED BY THE CLASSIFIER INCLUDED BOTH FIXED (E.G., NOSE SHAPE) AND TRANSIENT FACIAL FEATURES (E.G., GROOMING STYLE). CONSISTENT WITH THE PRENATAL HORMONE THEORY OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GAY MEN AND WOMEN TENDED TO HAVE GENDER-ATYPICAL FACIAL MORPHOLOGY, EXPRESSION, AND GROOMING STYLES.

AS A SOCIETY, THE FURTHER WE GET FROM THE BIRTH AND MANIPULATION OF AN IDEA, THE MORE LIKELY WE ARE TO FORGET IT UNTIL WE REACH A POINT WHERE WE ARE LEFT ONLY WITH THE THOUGHTS THAT WE COLLECTIVELY DECIDED ARE WORTH REMEMBERING. YET, WITHIN THIS SHEAF OF IDEAS IN TIME, THE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH IDEAS THAT HAVE STAYING POWER REMAIN A MYSTERY. IN THIS STUDY, WE STATISTICALLY MODELED BEHAVIORAL PROCESSES OF COMMUNAL FORGETTING, FILTERING, AND FACTUALISM USING LARGE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES ON SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGICAL INVENTIONS THAT ALLOW US TO TRACK THE REFERENCING OF IDEAS AND TECHNOLOGY OVER TIME. THE MODEL IDENTIFIES AND DISTINGUISHES RAPID FORGETTING - IDEAS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT ARE FORGOTTEN AFTER THEIR BIRTH EVEN IF THEY HAD INITIAL POPULARITY, AND LONG-LIVED FORGETTING -- IDEAS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT SLOWLY FADE FROM MEMORY. WE FIND THAT COLLECTIVE FORGETTING ACTS LIKE AN ANNULMENT PROCESS. AS INFORMATION GROWS, FORGETTING RATES INCREASE DESPITE THE GROWING CAPACITY TO STORE AND REFERENCE INFORMATION. FURTHER, OUR MODEL OF THE FORGETTING PROCESS FINDS THAT STICKY IDEAS AND TECHNOLOGY ARE SELECTIVE RATHER THAN REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SHEAF OF IDEAS THAT WERE POPULAR, AND THAT THE SELECTIVITY OF IDEAS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE CHANGES OVER TIME. HOW LONG WILL THIS ARTICLE BE REMEMBERED? HOW LONG WILL PEOPLE REFERENCE IT IN THEIR CONVERSATIONS, AND FOR HOW MANY YEARS WILL OTHER AUTHORS CITE ITS FINDINGS IN THEIR OWN WORKS? A COMMUNITY'S ATTENTION TO A CULTURAL OBJECT DECAYS AS TIME PASSES, A PROCESS KNOWN AS COLLECTIVE FORGETTING. RECENT WORK MODELS THIS DECAY AS THE RESULT OF TWO DIFFERENT PROCESSES. ONE LINKED TO COMMUNICATIVE MEMORY-MEMORIES SUSTAINED BY HUMAN COMMUNICATION-AND THE OTHER LINKED TO CULTURAL MEMORY-MEMORIES SUSTAINED BY THE PHYSICAL RECORDING OF CONTENT. COLLECTIVE FORGETTING HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THE COLLECTIVE FORGETTING DYNAMIC CHANGES OVER TIME. HERE, WE STUDY THE TEMPORAL CHANGES OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY AND ATTENTION BY FOCUSING ON TWO KNOWLEDGE COMMUNITIES: INVENTORS AND PHYSICISTS. WE USE DATA ON PATENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (USPTO) AND PHYSICS PAPERS PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY (APS) TO QUANTIFY THOSE CHANGES OVER TIME. THE MODEL ENABLES US TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TWO BRANCHES OF FORGETTING. ONE BRANCH IS SHORT-LIVED, GOING DIRECTLY FROM COMMUNICATIVE MEMORY TO OBLIVION. THE OTHER BRANCH IS LONG-LIVED, GOING FROM COMMUNICATIVE MEMORY TO CULTURAL MEMORY BEFORE GOING ON TO OBLIVION. THE DATA ANALYSIS SHOWS AN INCREASE IN THE FORGETTING RATE FOR BOTH COMMUNITIES AS THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN EACH OF THEM GROWS. THAT GROWTH OF INFORMATION FORCES KNOWLEDGE COMMUNITIES TO INCREASE THEIR SELECTIVITY REGARDING WHAT IS STORED IN THEIR CULTURAL MEMORY. THESE FINDINGS CONFIRM THE FORGETTING AS ANNULMENT HYPOTHESIS AND SHOW THAT KNOWLEDGE COMMUNITIES CAN SLOW DOWN COLLECTIVE FORGETTING AND IMPROVE SELECTIVITY PROCESSES.

HAVING ACCESS TO ANY TYPE OF INFORMATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS A POTENTIAL INFLUENCE ON THE GROWTH OF ANTI VACCINATION GROUPS. RECENT STUDIES W.R.T. OTHER TOPICS THAN VACCINATION SHOW THAT ACCESS TO A WIDE AMOUNT OF CONTENT THROUGH THE INTERNET WITHOUT INTERMEDIARIES RESOLVED INTO MAJOR SEGREGATION OF THE USERS IN POLARIZED GROUPS. USERS SELECT INFORMATION ADHERING TO THEIRS SYSTEM OF BELIEFS AND TEND TO IGNORE DISSENTING INFORMATION. OBJECTIVES: THE GOAL WAS TO ASSESS WHETHER USERS' ATTITUDES ARE POLARIZED ON THE TOPIC OF VACCINATION ON FACEBOOK AND HOW THIS POLARIZATION DEVELOPS OVER TIME. METHODS: WE PERFORM A THOROUGH QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS BY STUDYING THE INTERACTION OF 2.6 M USERS WITH 298,018 FACEBOOK POSTS OVER A TIME SPAN OF SEVEN YEARS AND 5 MONTHS. WE APPLIED COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS TO AUTOMATICALLY DETECT THE EMERGENCE OF COMMUNITIES ACCOUNTING FOR THE USERS' ACTIVITY ON THE PAGES. ALSO, WE QUANTIFIED THE COHESIVENESS OF THESE COMMUNITIES OVER TIME. RESULTS: OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE CONSUMPTION OF CONTENT ABOUT VACCINES IS DOMINATED BY THE ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT AND THAT POLARIZATION INCREASED OVER THE YEARS. WELL-SEGREGATED COMMUNITIES EMERGE FROM THE USERS' CONSUMPTION HABITS I.E., THE MAJORITY OF USERS CONSUME INFORMATION IN FAVOR OR AGAINST VACCINES, NOT BOTH. CONCLUSION: THE EXISTENCE OF ECHO CHAMBERS MAY EXPLAIN WHY SOCIAL-MEDIA CAMPAIGNS THAT PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION HAVE LIMITED REACH AND BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IN SUB-GROUPS, EVEN FOMENTING FURTHER OPINION POLARIZATION. THE INTRODUCTION OF DISSENTING INFORMATION INTO A SUB-GROUP IS DISREGARDED AND CAN PRODUCE A BACKFIRE EFFECT, THUS REINFORCING THE PRE-EXISTING OPINIONS WITHIN THE SUB-GROUP. PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SHOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTENTS OF THESE ECHO CHAMBERS, FOR EXAMPLE BY GETTING PASSIVELY INVOLVED IN SUCH GROUPS. ONLY THEN IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO FIND EFFECTIVE WAYS OF COUNTERING ANTI-VACCINATION THINKING. (C) 2018 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

HOWEVER, EACH GROUPING HAS AN EXCEPTION: ONE MENTOR HAS AN ADDITIONAL HIDDEN CAPABILITY THAT CAN BE MENTORED TO THEIR PROTEGES. THEY DISPLAY SKILL IN CREATING AND COMMUNICATING PRIZEWINNING RESEARCH. BECAUSE THE MENTOR'S ABILITY FOR CREATING AND COMMUNICATING CELEBRATED RESEARCH EXISTED BEFORE THE PRIZE'S CONFERMENT, PROTEGES OF FUTURE PRIZEWINNING MENTORS CAN BE UNIQUELY EXPOSED TO MENTORSHIP FOR CONDUCTING CELEBRATED RESEARCH. OUR MODELS EXPLAIN 34-44% OF THE VARIANCE IN PROTEGE SUCCESS AND REVEALS THREE MAIN FINDINGS. FIRST, MENTORSHIP STRONGLY PREDICTS PROTEGE SUCCESS ACROSS DIVERSE DISCIPLINES. MENTORSHIP IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 2X-TO4X RISE IN A PROTEGE'S LIKELIHOOD OF PRIZEWINNING, NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE (NAS) INDUCTION, OR SUPERSTARDOM RELATIVE TO MATCHED PROTEGES. SECOND, MENTORSHIP IS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE PROBABILITY OF PROTEGES PIONEERING THEIR OWN RESEARCH TOPICS AND BEING MIDCAREER LATE BLOOMERS.

HOWEVER, THIS EFFECT OF SOCIAL TIES IS DIFFICULT TO MEASURE AND QUANTIFY, BECAUSE SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE MULTIDIMENSIONAL AND DYNAMICALLY EVOLVING WITHIN THE EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT. WE REPEATEDLY SURVEYED A COHORT OF 226 ENGINEERING UNDERGRADUATES BETWEEN THEIR FIRST DAY AT UNIVERSITY AND A CRUCIAL EXAMINATION AT THE END OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR. WE INVESTIGATE HOW SOCIAL NETWORKS EMERGE BETWEEN PREVIOUSLY UNACQUAINTED STUDENTS AND HOW INTEGRATION IN THESE NETWORKS EXPLAINS ACADEMIC SUCCESS.

TO THIS END, WE CURATED A REPRESENTATIVE DATASET COVERING 1466 PRIZEWINNING SCIENTISTS FROM 35 PRESTIGIOUS SCIENTIFIC PRIZES IN SEVEN DISCIPLINES. TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF ONE'S ACADEMIC CAREER FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF A PRIZE, WE MATCHED EACH PRIZEWINNER WITH CONTENDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WINNER AND THE CONTENDERS HAVE COMPARABLE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE BEFORE PRIZEWINNING. THEN THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF PRIZEWINNERS AND CONTENDERS IN THE SAME GROUP ARE COMPARED ON THREE DIMENSIONS - PRODUCTIVITY, SCIENTIFIC IMPACT, AND CAREER PERSISTENCE. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT AFTER WINNING A PRESTIGIOUS PRIZE, SCIENTISTS GENERALLY PUBLISH MORE PAPERS AND RECEIVE MORE CITATIONS COMPARED TO THEIR CONTENDERS. AS FOR PERSISTENCE, THE KAPLAN-MEIER ESTIMATES ON CAREER LENGTH AFTER THE PRIZEWINNING SHOW THAT SCIENTISTS TEND TO MAINTAIN A LONGER ACTIVE RESEARCH CAREER IF THEIR SCIENTIFIC MERIT ARE RECOGNIZED VIA PRIZEWINNING. IN ADDITION, WHEN DIVIDING THE PRIZEWINNERS INTO THREE SUBGROUPS WHICH ARE YOUNG, MIDDLE-AGED, AND SENIOR PRIZEWINNERS, WE FOUND THAT SCIENTISTS TEND TO MAINTAIN A LONGER ACTIVE CAREER IF THEY WIN PRIZES AT THE YOUNG OR MIDDLE-AGED CAREER STAGE, WHILE THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN SENIOR PRIZEWINNERS AND THEIR CONTENDERS.

TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, WE DESCRIBE A STATISTICAL APPROACH TO MODELING BEHAVIORAL DATA CALLED THE STRUCTURED SUM-OF-SQUARES DECOMPOSITION (S3D). THE ALGORITHM, WHICH IS INSPIRED BY DECISION TREES, SELECTS IMPORTANT FEATURES THAT COLLECTIVELY EXPLAIN THE VARIATION OF THE OUTCOME, QUANTIFIES CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE FEATURES, AND BINS THE SUBSPACE OF IMPORTANT FEATURES INTO SMALLER, MORE HOMOGENEOUS BLOCKS THAT CORRESPOND TO SIMILARLY-BEHAVING SUBGROUPS WITHIN THE POPULATION.

SUCH AGENTS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MODERATE ONLINE DISCUSSIONS AND EVEN MANIPULATE AND ALTER PUBLIC OPINIONS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE TO STUDY THIS PHENOMENON USING A CONSTRUCTED LARGE-SCALE AGENT PLATFORM. AT THE HEART OF THE PLATFORM LIES AN ARTIFICIAL AGENT THAT CAN MODERATE ONLINE DISCUSSIONS USING ARGUMENTATIVE MESSAGES. WE INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF THE AGENT ON THE EVOLUTION OF AN ONLINE DEBATE INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS. THE AGENT WILL DYNAMICALLY REACT TO THEIR MESSAGES BY MODERATING, SUPPORTING, OR ATTACKING THEIR STANCES. WE CONDUCTED TWO EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE THE PLATFORM WHILE LOOKING AT THE EFFECTS OF THE CONVERSATIONAL AGENT. THE FIRST EXPERIMENT IS A LARGE-SCALE DISCUSSION WITH 1076 CITIZENS FROM AFGHANISTAN DISCUSSING URBAN POLICY-MAKING IN THE CITY OF KABUL. THE GOAL OF THE EXPERIMENT WAS TO INCREASE THE CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT IN IMPLEMENTING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. THE SECOND EXPERIMENT IS A SMALL-SCALE DEBATE BETWEEN A GROUP OF 16 STUDENTS ABOUT GLOBALISATION AND TAXATION IN MYANMAR. IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT, WE FOUND THAT THE AGENT IMPROVED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE PARTICIPANTS AND INCREASED THE NUMBER OF IDENTIFIED IDEAS AND ISSUES. IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT, WE FOUND THAT THE AGENT POLARISED THE DEBATE BY REINFORCING THE INITIAL STANCES OF THE PARTICIPANT.

THIS STUDY INTRODUCES NESTED GINI COEFFICIENTS THAT HELP ANSWER THIS QUESTION BY DISENTANGLING CONCENTRATIONS OF CRIME AT MULTIPLE SCALES IN A SINGLE CITY WHILE ALSO CONTROLLING FOR ARTIFACTS OF ARITHMETIC AND URBAN FORM. METHODS: THE STUDY EXAMINES SIX INDICES OF CRIME AND DISORDER DRAWN FROM REQUESTS FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICES RECEIVED BY THE CITY OF BOSTON IN 2011 FOR ADDRESSES (N = 98,355) NESTED IN STREET SEGMENTS (N = 13,048) NESTED IN CENSUS TRACTS (N = 178). NESTED GINI COEFFICIENTS ASSESSED THE AVERAGE CONCENTRATION AT EACH LEVEL INDEPENDENT OF THE HIGHER GEOGRAPHIC UNIT (E.G., THE STREETS OF A SINGLE TRACT). RESULTS: CONCENTRATIONS WERE GREATEST AT ADDRESSES, THEN AT STREETS, AND THEN AT TRACTS. COMPARED TO WHOLE-CITY CALCULATIONS, THEY SHOWED EQUAL OR GREATER LEVELS OF CONCENTRATION OF CRIME AND DISORDER FOR ADDRESSES, BUT LOWER CONCENTRATIONS FOR STREETS. CONTROLLING FOR THE NUMBER OF LOCATIONS ON A STREET OR IN A TRACT ALSO MARKEDLY DIMINISHED CONCENTRATIONS.

WE BEGIN BY DEFINING WHAT WE MEAN BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) IN THIS CONTEXT. WE THEN LAY OUT OUR SPECIFICATION FOR HOW AI-BASED MODELS CAN DRAW ON THE GROWING AVAILABILITY OF DIGITAL DATA TO HELP TEST THE VALIDITY OF DIFFERENT SOCIAL THEORIES BASED ON THEIR PREDICTIVE POWER. IN DOING SO, WE USE THE WORK OF RANDALL COLLINS AND HIS STATE BREAKDOWN MODEL TO EXEMPLIFY THAT, ALREADY TODAY, AI-BASED MODELS CAN HELP SYNTHESISE KNOWLEDGE FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, REASON ABOUT THE WORLD, AND APPLY WHAT IS KNOWN ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF PROBLEMS IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY. HOWEVER, WE ALSO FIND THAT AI-DRIVEN SOCIAL THEORY REMAINS SUBJECT TO A RANGE OF PRACTICAL, TECHNICAL, AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. MOST CRITICALLY, EXISTING AI-SYSTEMS LACK THREE ESSENTIAL CAPABILITIES NEEDED TO ADVANCE SOCIAL THEORY IN WAYS THAT ARE CUMULATIVE, HOLISTIC, OPEN-ENDED, AND PURPOSEFUL. THESE ARE (1) SEMANTICISATION, I.E., THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND OPERATIONALIZE VERBAL CONCEPTS TO REPRESENT MACHINE-MANIPULABLE KNOWLEDGE; (2) TRANSFERABILITY, I.E., THE ABILITY TO TRANSFER WHAT HAS BEEN LEARNED IN ONE CONTEXT TO ANOTHER; AND (3) GENERATIVITY, I.E., THE ABILITY TO INDEPENDENTLY CREATE AND IMPROVE ON CONCEPTS AND MODELS. WE ARGUE THAT IF THE GAPS IDENTIFIED HERE ARE ADDRESSED BY FURTHER RESEARCH, THERE IS NO REASON WHY, IN THE FUTURE, THE MOST ADVANCED PROGRAMME IN SOCIAL THEORY SHOULD NOT BE LED BY AI-DRIVEN CUMULATIVE ADVANCES.

TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT, THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE CASE OF PUBLIC DEBATES OVER WHETHER SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES SHOULD DEPLATFORM TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE JANUARY 6, 2021 CAPITOL INSURRECTION. PUBLIC COMMENTS WERE OBTAINED FROM A DATASET COMPILED AND RELEASED BY FACEBOOK OVERSIGHT BOARD. FIRST, I USED STRUCTURAL TOPIC MODELING TO IDENTIFY THE REASONING AND USED THE DICTIONARY BASED ON THE MORAL FOUNDATIONS THEORY TO GAUGE MORAL FOUNDATIONS IN EACH DOCUMENT. THEN, I USED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE WHETHER THERE WAS A CORRELATION BETWEEN SPECIFIC REASONING AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PRO- AND ANTI-DEPLATFORMING CAMPS IN THE DEBATE ARE DIVIDED NOT ONLY IN REASONING, BUT ALSO IN MORALITY. SUPPORTERS OF DEPLATFORMING ARGUE THAT IT WOULD FULFILL TECH COMPANIES' PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITY, AND PROTECT SOCIETY AT LARGE. THESE ARGUMENTS ARE CORRELATED WITH THE CARE FOUNDATION. IN CONTRAST, OPPONENTS ARGUE THAT DEPLATFORMING TRUMP VIOLATED FREEDOM OF SPEECH. THIS ARGUMENT IS CORRELATED WITH THE FAIRNESS, LOYALTY, AND AUTHORITY FOUNDATIONS, BUT NOT THE CARE FOUNDATION.

WE FIND THAT MOVEMENTS IN VIRTUAL HUMAN LIVES FOLLOW THE SAME HIGH LEVELS OF PREDICTABILITY AS OFFLINE MOBILITY, WHERE FUTURE MOVEMENTS CAN, TO SOME EXTENT, BE PREDICTED WELL IF THE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS OF VISITED PLACES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR. TIME SERIES OF BEHAVIORAL ACTIONS SHOW SIMILAR HIGH LEVELS OF PREDICTABILITY, EVEN WHEN TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS ARE NEGLECTED. ENTROPY CONDITIONAL ON SPECIFIC BEHAVIORAL ACTIONS REVEALS THAT IN TERMS OF PREDICTABILITY, NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR HAS A WIDER VARIETY THAN POSITIVE ACTIONS. THE ACTIONS THAT CONTAIN THE INFORMATION TO BEST PREDICT AN INDIVIDUAL'S SUBSEQUENT ACTION ARE NEGATIVE, SUCH AS ATTACKS OR ENEMY MARKINGS, WHILE THE POSITIVE ACTIONS OF FRIENDSHIP MARKING, TRADE AND COMMUNICATION CONTAIN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF PREDICTIVE INFORMATION. THESE OBSERVATIONS SHOW THAT PREDICTING BEHAVIORAL ACTIONS REQUIRES LESS INFORMATION THAN PREDICTING THE MOBILITY PATTERNS OF HUMANS FOR WHICH THE ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF PAST VISITED LOCATIONS IS CRUCIAL AND THAT THE TYPE AND SIGN OF A SOCIAL RELATION HAS AN ESSENTIAL IMPACT ON THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE FUTURE BEHAVIOR.

WE USED OVER 2,000,000 GEOCODED EMERGENCY AND NON-EMERGENCY REQUESTS RECEIVED BY THE CITY OF BOSTON'S 911 AND 311 SYSTEMS FROM 2011-2013 TO CALCULATE SIX INDICES OF VIOLENT CRIME, PHYSICAL DISORDER, AND SOCIAL DISORDER FOR ALL ADDRESSES (N = 123,265). WE LINKED ADDRESSES TO THEIR STREET SEGMENT (N = 13,767) AND CENSUS TRACT (N = 178), CREATING A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY THAT ENABLED A SERIES OF MULTILEVEL POISSON HIERARCHICAL MODELS. LESS THAN 1% OF ADDRESSES GENERATED 25% OF REPORTS OF CRIME AND DISORDER. ACROSS INDICES, 95-99% OF VARIANCE WAS AT THE ADDRESS LEVEL, THOUGH THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT CLUSTERING AT THE STREET SEGMENT AND NEIGHBORHOOD LEVELS. MODELS WITH LAG PREDICTORS FOUND THAT LEVELS OF CRIME AND DISORDER PERSISTED ACROSS YEARS FOR ALL OUTCOMES AT ALL THREE GEOGRAPHIC LEVELS, WITH STRONGER EFFECTS AT HIGHER GEOGRAPHIC LEVELS. DISTINCTIVELY, SIMILAR TO 15% OF ADDRESSES GENERATED CRIME OR DISORDER IN ONE YEAR AND NOT IN THE OTHER.

DESPITE LONG-TERM EFFORTS, OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW SES INFLUENCES THE STRENGTH AND TYPES OF SOCIAL RELATIONS IS STILL LIMITED. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED A LARGE MOBILE PHONE DATASET IN BEIJING, CHINA, TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SES AND THE STRENGTH AND TYPES OF SOCIAL RELATIONS AT AN URBAN POPULATION LEVEL. SPECIFICALLY, WE DIVIDED THE SOCIAL RELATIONS INTO THREE TYPES BASED ON USERS' SPATIOTEMPORAL MOBILITY SIMILARITY: (1) FAMILY MEMBERS WITH HIGH SIMILARITY ON WEEKDAY NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS; (2) COWORKERS WITH HIGH SIMILARITY ON WEEKDAYS DURING THE DAYTIME; (3) FRIENDS WITH LOW SIMILARITY ALL THE TIME. AN INDIVIDUAL'S SES WAS REPRESENTED BY THE HOUSING PRICE IN THE HOME LOCATION. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT PEOPLE OF HIGHER SES (LIVING IN AREAS WITH HIGHER HOUSING PRICES) TEND TO INTERACT LESS WITH OTHERS AND ALLOCATE MORE TIME WITH FRIENDS BUT LESS TIME WITH FAMILY AND COWORKERS THAN PEOPLE OF LOWER SES. BESIDES, PEOPLE OF HIGHER SES SPLIT THEIR TIME MORE UNEVENLY TO DIFFERENT SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. THESE FINDINGS SHED LIGHT ON SOLUTIONS RELATED TO SES AND INEQUALITY.

OUR PROPOSED MODEL THAT UTILIZES ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY INFORMATION OF INDIVIDUAL USERS FROM OTHER SIMILAR TYPES OF GIFTING APPLICATIONS CAN ACHIEVE HIGH PRECISION (83%) IN PREDICTING ADOPTIONS IN THE TARGET APPLICATION (I.E., IHEART). WE NEXT IDENTIFY A SET OF DISTINCTIVE FEATURES THAT ARE GOOD PREDICTORS OF THE GROWTH OF THE APPLICATION ADOPTIONS IN TERMS OF FINAL POPULATION SIZE. WE FINALLY PROPOSE A PREDICTION MODEL TO INFER WHETHER A CASCADE OF APPLICATION ADOPTION WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IN THE FUTURE BASED ON OBSERVING THE INITIAL ADOPTION PROCESS. RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR PROPOSED MODEL CAN ACHIEVE HIGH PRECISION (OVER 80%) IN PREDICTING LARGE CASCADES OF APPLICATION ADOPTIONS. WE BELIEVE OUR WORK CAN GIVE AN IMPORTANT IMPLICATION IN RESOURCE ALLOCATION OF OSN-BASED PRODUCT STAKEHOLDERS, FOR EXAMPLE, VIA TARGETED MARKETING.

THEREFORE, A PLETHORA OF METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES HAVE BEEN APPLIED, SUCH AS CASE STUDIES, EXPERT INTERVIEWS, OBSERVATIONS, OR AGENT-BASED APPROACHES. THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE APPLICABILITY OF THESE METHODOLOGICAL EFFORTS FOR JOURNALISM STUDIES, SHOWING THAT ALL OF THESE APPROACHES FACE THEIR LIMITATIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO EXTERNAL VALIDITY, RECRUITMENT DIFFICULTIES, AND DATA RELIABILITY. THEREBY, AGENT-BASED TESTING REPRESENTS ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING APPROACHES TO OVERCOME PLENTY OF THESE METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. AGENT-BASED TESTING IS A SYSTEMATIC AND EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH THAT EMULATES ONLINE HUMAN BEHAVIOR TO TEST ALGORITHMICALLY CURATED MEDIA ENVIRONMENTS UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS. FOR THIS TO BE ACHIEVED PROPERLY, THIS PAPER SUGGESTS A MULTITUDE OF SETTINGS AND REQUIREMENTS TO ADEQUATELY FACE THE TECHNOLOGICAL, LEGAL, AND ETHICAL CHALLENGES, WHICH COME WITH THE EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF ALGORITHMIC CONTENT CURATION.

RECENTLY, WE ARE WITNESSING AN ASPIRATION IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE THE DATA ABOUT HUMAN BEHAVIOR THAT IS BEING PRODUCED WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED DEPTH AND SCALE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DISCUSS HOW THIS NEW DATA MAY IMPACT SOCIOLOGY. BIG DATA HAS BEEN DEFINED IN VARIOUS WAYS IN LITERATURE. SOME OF THE LATEST WORKS REVEAL THAT THE KEY DEFINITIONAL BOUNDARY MARKER IS NOT THE VOLUME OF DATA PRODUCED, BUT THE TRAITS OF VELOCITY AND EXHAUSTIVITY. THE DIFFERENCES OF THIS NEW TYPE OF DATA ARE THAT IT IS NOT CREATED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES, THAT IT COVERS THE ENTIRE POPULATION, AND THAT IT IS PRODUCED IN REAL-TIME. THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF KEY CHANGES IN SOCIOLOGY IN THE ERA OF BIG DATA. FIRST, NEW ONLINE-DATA CAN GREATLY IMPROVE TRADITIONAL SOCIOLOGICAL SUBFIELDS WHICH WERE PREVENTED FROM BEING DEVELOPED BECAUSE OF A LACK OF DATA. NOW, THERE ARE NEW RESULTS BASED ON ONLINE-DATA WHICH SHED LIGHT ON THE CAUSAL EFFECT OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE. BIG DATA CAN ALSO ENABLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LINES OF RESEARCH BECAUSE OF RAPIDLY-DEVELOPING COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE RESEARCH AREAS WHICH DEAL WITH LARGE BODIES OF TEXT, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, NEW TECHNIQUES CAN GREATLY IMPROVE THE SOCIOLOGY OF CULTURE WHERE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH HAS BEEN LESS DEVELOPED WHEN COMPARED WITH THEORETICAL IDEAS. SECONDLY, NEW DATA CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE DISCIPLINARY PROJECT OF SOCIOLOGY. THE ARTICLE ENDS WITH THE DISCUSSION OF HOW BIG DATA CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT DATA-DRIVEN SOCIOLOGY, WHICH DIFFERS FROM MAINSTREAM SOCIOLOGY WHERE HYPOTHESES ARE OFFERED A PRIORI, DATA IS COLLECTED, AND ANALYSES ARE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE HYPOTHESES ARE SUPPORTED.

IMPORTANTLY, THIS STUDY ARGUES TO LOOK AT CANDIDATE IMAGERY AS INSTITUTIONALIZED MEANS OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATION ONLINE.

SOCIAL SET ANALYSIS CONSISTS OF A GENERATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR THE PHILOSOPHIES OF COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE, THEORY OF SOCIAL DATA, CONCEPTUAL AND FORMAL MODELS OF SOCIAL DATA, AND AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR COMBINING BIG SOCIAL DATA SETS WITH ORGANIZATIONAL AND SOCIETAL DATA SETS. THREE EMPIRICAL STUDIES OF BIG SOCIAL DATA ARE PRESENTED TO ILLUSTRATE AND DEMONSTRATE SOCIAL SET ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF FUZZY SET-THEORETICAL SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, CRISP SET-THEORETICAL INTERACTION ANALYSIS, AND EVENT STUDIES-ORIENTED SET-THEORETICAL VISUALIZATIONS. IMPLICATIONS FOR BIG DATA ANALYTICS, CURRENT LIMITATIONS OF THE SET-THEORETICAL APPROACH, AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS ARE OUTLINED.

THE APPROACH IS SCALABLE ACROSS MULTIPLE CONTEXTS AND COMPLEMENTS THE DOMINANT IDIOGRAPHIC MODES OF SOCIOMATERIAL INQUIRY. THE APPROACH IS ROOTED IN THE EPISTEMOLOGY OF A ""RATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION"" CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERPRETIVE STANCE UNDERLYING THE SOCIOMATERIAL POSITION. IT ARMS RESEARCHERS WITH THE MEANS TO SEEK AND UNCOVER REGULARITIES IN THE WAYS HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND DIGITAL CAPABILITIES BECOME ENTANGLED ACROSS CONTEXTS BY ENABLING THE IDENTIFICATION AND ARTICULATION OF GENERALIZABLE PATTERNS OF SOCIOMATERIAL ACTIVITY. THE COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH IS FOUNDED ON SEQUENCE-ANALYTIC TECHNIQUES THAT ORIGINATED FROM THE FIELD OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY (GENETICS), BUT ARE NOW GAINING POPULARITY IN THE STUDY OF TEMPORALLY ORDERED SOCIAL PHENOMENA SUCH AS ORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES. THESE TECHNIQUES ARE EXTENDED BY DRAWING UPON THEORETICAL INSIGHTS GAINED WITHIN SOCIOMATERIAL SCHOLARSHIP ON HOW THE DIGITAL AND THE SOCIAL BECOME ENTANGLED. BY DETECTING THE VARIATION IN ACTIVITIES, ACTORS, ARTIFACTS, AND AFFORDANCES THAT COMPRISE WHAT WE DENOTE A SOCIOMATERIAL ROUTINE, THE APPROACH DIRECTLY ATTENDS TO WAYS IN WHICH HUMAN ACTORS AND THE MATERIAL FEATURES OF TECHNOLOGY BECOME ENTANGLED IN PATTERNS OF PRACTICE.

HOWEVER, APPLYING ML APPROACHES TO SCHOOL DROPOUT PREDICTION IS AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE, ESPECIALLY IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES, WHERE DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE RELATIVELY MORE PRONE TO FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS. FOR THIS REASON, THIS STUDY SUGGESTS USING ALREADY COLLECTED HOUSEHOLD PANEL DATA TO PREDICT THE PROBABILITY OF SCHOOL DROPOUT AND EXPLORE FEATURE IMPORTANCE FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN MALAWI THROUGH ML MODELS. A RICH SET OF VARIABLES IS OBTAINED IN THIS STUDY FROM THE HOUSEHOLD DATA AND USED TO BUILD RANDOM FOREST (RF), LEAST ABSOLUTE SHRINKAGE AND SELECTION OPERATOR (LASSO), RIDGE AND MULTILAYER NEURAL NETWORK (MNN) MODELS. THE STUDY FURTHER EXPLORES HOW PERFORMANCE METRICS DIFFER WHEN WE EMBED THE TRAINING SAMPLES' WEIGHTS REPRESENTING FREQUENCY IN SAMPLING DESIGN INTO THE COST FUNCTION OF THESE ML MODELS TO DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS OF USING HOUSEHOLD DATA IN COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE. LASSO AND MNN MODELS TRAINED WITH SAMPLE WEIGHTS BECOME MORE PROMINENT DUE TO THEIR HIGHER RECALL RATES OF 80.6% AND 78.8%. COMPARED TO THE BASELINE MODEL TRAINED WITH SAMPLE WEIGHTS, THE RECALL RATE GAINED IS ROUGHLY 56 PERCENTAGE POINTS USING LASSO AND 54 PERCENTAGE POINTS USING MNN. ALSO, COMPARING LASSO AND MNN TRAINED WITH AND WITHOUT SAMPLE WEIGHTS REVEALS THAT TRAINING MODELS WITH SAMPLE WEIGHTS INCREASE THE RECALL RATE ROUGHLY BY 11 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR LASSO AND 12 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR MNN. LASTLY, THE PAPER PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE AND UNIFIED APPROACH TO BETTER INTERPRET THE MODELS USING A GAME-THEORETIC APPROACH - SHAPLEY ADDITIVE EXPLANATIONS (SHAP) - TO QUANTIFY FEATURE IMPORTANCE. AS A RESULT, SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILDREN, SUCH AS WORKING IN HOUSEHOLD FARMING AND FATHER'S EDUCATION LEVEL, ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROBABILITY OF SCHOOL DROPOUT IN ML MODELS. THIS STUDY ARGUES THAT THE WEIGHTED SAMPLE STRUCTURE OF HOUSEHOLD DATA AND ITS WIDE RANGE OF VARIABLES EXPLORED THROUGH THE SHAP METHOD FOR FEATURE IMPORTANCE CAN ENRICH THE LITERATURE AND YIELD VALUABLE RESULTS TO HARNESS DATA SCIENCE FOR SOCIETY.

A COMPARISON OF THEORY-DRIVEN AND EMPIRICAL AGENT BASED MODELS COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE HAS WITNESSED A SHIFT FROM PURE THEORETICAL TO EMPIRICAL AGENT-BASED MODELS (ABMS) GROUNDED IN DATA-DRIVEN CORRELATIONS BETWEEN BEHAVIORAL FACTORS DEFINING AGENTS' DECISIONS. THERE IS A STRONG URGE TO GO BEYOND THEORETICAL ABMS WITH BEHAVIORAL THEORIES SETTING STYLIZED RULES THAT GUIDE AGENTS' ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CONCERNS POLICY-RELATED SIMULATIONS. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT THEORY-DRIVEN ABMS MISLEAD, IF AT ALL, A CHOICE OF A POLICY WHEN COMPARED TO THE OUTCOMES OF MODELS WITH EMPIRICAL MICRO-FOUNDATIONS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY RELEVANT FOR PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES THAT INCREASINGLY RELY ON QUANTIFYING CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIORAL CHANGES, WHERE ABMS ARE SO HELPFUL. WE PROPOSE A COMPARISON FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THIS METHODOLOGICAL DILEMMA, WHICH QUANTITATIVELY EXPLORES THE GAP IN PREDICTIONS BETWEEN THEORY- AND DATA-DRIVEN ABMS. INSPIRED BY THE EXISTING THEORY-DRIVEN MODEL, ORVIN-T, WHICH STUDIES THE INDIVIDUAL CHOICE BETWEEN ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL PRODUCTS, WE DESIGN A SURVEY TO COLLECT DATA ON INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES AND PURCHASING DECISIONS. WE THEN USE THIS EXTENSIVE EMPIRICAL MICRODATA TO BUILD AN EMPIRICAL TWIN, ORVIN-E, REPLACING THE THEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND SECONDARY AGGREGATED DATA USED TO PARAMETRIZE AGENTS' DECISION STRATEGIES WITH OUR EMPIRICAL SURVEY DATA. WE COMPARE THE MODELS IN TERMS OF KEY OUTPUTS, PERFORM SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND EXPLORE THREE POLICY SCENARIOS. WE OBSERVE THAT THE THEORY-DRIVEN MODEL PREDICTS THE SHIFTS TO ORGANIC CONSUMPTION AS ACCURATELY AS THE ABM WITH EMPIRICAL MICRO-FOUNDATIONS AT BOTH AGGREGATED AND INDIVIDUAL SCALES. THERE ARE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES (SIMILAR TO 5%) BETWEEN THE ESTIMATIONS OF THE TWO MODELS WITH REGARD TO DIFFERENT BEHAVIORAL CHANGE SCENARIOS: INCREASING CONVENTIONAL TAX, LAUNCHING ORGANIC SOCIAL-INFORMATIONAL CAMPAIGNS, AND THEIR COMBINATION. OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE GOODNESS OF FIT AND USEFULNESS OF THEORETICAL MODELING EFFORTS, AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF INCREMENTAL BEHAVIORAL CHANGE.

THE REQUIRED REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IMPLY A MASSIVE DECARBONIZATION WORLDWIDE WITH MUCH INVOLVEMENT OF REGIONS, CITIES, BUSINESSES, AND INDIVIDUALS IN ADDITION TO THE COMMITMENTS AT THE NATIONAL LEVELS. IMPROVING END-USE EFFICIENCY IS EMPHASIZED IN PREVIOUS IPCC REPORTS (IPCC 2014). SERVING AS THE PRIMARY 'AGENTS OF CHANGE' IN THE TRANSFORMATIVE PROCESS TOWARDS GREEN ECONOMIES, HOUSEHOLDS HAVE A KEY ROLE IN GLOBAL EMISSION REDUCTION. INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN AMPLIFIED THROUGH SOCIAL DYNAMICS, SHAPE GREEN ENERGY DEMAND AND AFFECT INVESTMENTS IN NEW ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES THAT COLLECTIVELY CAN CURB REGIONAL AND NATIONAL EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, MOST ENERGY-ECONOMICS MODELS-USUALLY BASED ON EQUILIBRIUM AND OPTIMIZATION ASSUMPTIONS-HAVE A VERY LIMITED REPRESENTATION OF HOUSEHOLD HETEROGENEITY AND TREAT HOUSEHOLDS AS PURELY RATIONAL ECONOMIC ACTORS. THIS PAPER ILLUSTRATES HOW COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE MODELS CAN COMPLEMENT TRADITIONAL MODELS BY ADDRESSING THIS LIMITATION. WE DEMONSTRATE THE USEFULNESS OF BEHAVIORALLY RICH AGENT-BASED COMPUTATIONAL MODELS BY SIMULATING VARIOUS BEHAVIORAL AND CLIMATE SCENARIOS FOR RESIDENTIAL ELECTRICITY DEMAND AND COMPARE THEM WITH THE BUSINESS AS USUAL (SSP2) SCENARIO. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT RESIDENTIAL ENERGY DEMAND IS STRONGLY LINKED TO PERSONAL AND SOCIAL NORMS. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM SURVEYS REVEALS THAT SOCIAL NORMS HAVE AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN SHAPING PERSONAL NORMS. WHEN ASSESSING THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS OF THESE BEHAVIORAL PROCESSES, WE QUANTIFY INDIVIDUAL AND COMBINED EFFECTS OF SOCIAL DYNAMICS AND OF CARBON PRICING ON INDIVIDUAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ON THE AGGREGATED REGIONAL ENERGY DEMAND AND EMISSIONS. THE INTENSITY OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND LEARNING PLAYS AN EQUALLY IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THE UPTAKE OF GREEN TECHNOLOGIES AS ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS, AND THEREFORE IN ADDITION TO CARBON-PRICE POLICIES (TOP-DOWN APPROACH), IMPLEMENTING POLICIES ON EDUCATION, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL PRACTICES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE RESIDENTIAL CARBON EMISSIONS.

NEVERTHELESS, ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF GENDER INFORMATION (I.E., GENDER DISTRIBUTION) IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, AND THEREFORE, IT HAS RARELY BEEN CONSIDERED FOR GENDER RESEARCH. HENCE, THIS PAPER AIMS TO RESOLVE THE MATTER OF INCOMPLETE GENDER INFORMATION AND MAKE THE ANONYMOUS NEWS COMMENT DATA USABLE FOR GENDER RESEARCH AS NEW SOCIAL MEDIA BIG DATA. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A MACHINE-LEARNING-BASED APPROACH FOR PREDICTING THE GENDER DISTRIBUTION (I.E., MALE AND FEMALE RATES) OF ANONYMOUS NEWS COMMENTERS FOR A NEWS ARTICLE. INITIALLY, THE BIG DATA OF NEWS ARTICLES AND THEIR ANONYMOUS NEWS COMMENTS WERE COLLECTED AND DIVIDED INTO LABELED AND UNLABELED DATASETS (I.E., WITH AND WITHOUT GENDER INFORMATION). THE WORD2VEC APPROACH WAS EMPLOYED TO REPRESENT A NEWS ARTICLE BY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NEWS COMMENTS. THEN, USING THE LABELED DATASET, VARIOUS PREDICTION TECHNIQUES WERE EVALUATED FOR PREDICTING THE GENDER DISTRIBUTION OF ANONYMOUS NEWS COMMENTERS FOR A LABELED NEWS ARTICLE. AS A RESULT, THE NEURAL NETWORK WAS SELECTED AS THE BEST PREDICTION TECHNIQUE, AND IT COULD ACCURATELY PREDICT THE GENDER DISTRIBUTION OF ANONYMOUS NEWS COMMENTERS OF THE LABELED NEWS ARTICLE. THUS, THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT A MACHINE-LEARNING-BASED APPROACH CAN OVERCOME THE INCOMPLETE GENDER INFORMATION PROBLEM OF ANONYMOUS SOCIAL MEDIA USERS. MOREOVER, WHEN THE GENDER DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE UNLABELED NEWS ARTICLES WERE PREDICTED USING THE BEST NEURAL NETWORK MODEL, TRAINED WITH THE LABELED DATASET, THEIR DISTRIBUTION TURNED OUT DIFFERENT FROM THE LABELED NEWS ARTICLES. THE RESULT INDICATES THAT USING ONLY THE LABELED DATASET FOR GENDER RESEARCH CAN RESULT IN MISLEADING FINDINGS AND DISTORTED CONCLUSIONS. THE PREDICTED GENDER DISTRIBUTIONS FOR THE UNLABELED NEWS ARTICLES CAN HELP TO BETTER UNDERSTAND ANONYMOUS NEWS COMMENTERS AS HUMANS FOR SUSTAINABLE SOCIETIES. EVENTUALLY, THIS STUDY PROVIDES A NEW WAY FOR DATA-DRIVEN COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE WITH INCOMPLETE AND ANONYMOUS SOCIAL MEDIA BIG DATA.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE CONTENT OF TOPICAL FLUORIDE-RELATED TWITTER POSTS MADE OVER A 3-YEAR PERIOD IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF TWITTER USERS' PERCEPTIONS AND TREATMENT EXPERIENCES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CONTINUOUS CROSS-SECTIONAL SAMPLE OF TWEETS ON THE SUBJECT OF 'APPROACHES TO THE TOPICAL FLUORIDE TREATMENT OF TOOTH DECAY' WAS COLLECTED FROM THE TWITTER SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORM BETWEEN 1 JANUARY 2017 AND 1 JANUARY 2020 USING A SOFTWARE APPLICATION DEVELOPED FOR THIS RESEARCH THAT MAKES USE OF THE TWITTER ADVANCED SEARCH API. THE WORDS AND PHRASES USED FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF RELATED TWEETS WERE DETERMINED THROUGH A SCREENING OF THE TOPICAL FLUORIDE KEYWORDS OF PREVIOUS STUDIES, AND A SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. TO BETTER ARRANGE THE COLLECTED TWEETS AND TO MAKE THE DATA MORE MEANINGFUL, FIRSTLY ONE OF THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESS TECHNIQUES - TOKENIZATION - WAS APPLIED, AFTER WHICH THE TWEETS WERE CONVERTED INTO A SET OF MEANINGFUL WORDS AND REGULAR EXPRESSIONS.

SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL BREAKS DURING 1995-1996, 2006-2008, AND 2011-2013 WERE IDENTIFIED IN DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATIONS. A STEADY INCREASE IN MARIJUANA USE AMONG ADOLESCENTS DURING THE LATTER YEARS OF THIS TIME PERIOD WAS IDENTIFIED. ADOLESCENTS WHO WERE MALE, WERE NON-BLACK, LIVED IN NONINTACT FAMILIES, AND HAD LESS EDUCATED PARENTS WERE ESPECIALLY AT RISK OF MARIJUANA USAGE.

THIS POSITION PAPER IS BASED ON A KEYNOTE PRESENTATION AT THE COLING 2016 WORKSHOP ON LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY FOR DIGITAL HUMANITIES IN OSAKA, JAPAN. IT DEPARTS FROM OBSERVATIONS ABOUT WORKING PRACTICES IN HUMANITIES DISCIPLINES FOLLOWING A HERMENEUTIC TRADITION OF TEXT INTERPRETATION VERSUS THE METHOD-ORIENTED RESEARCH STRATEGIES IN COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (CL). THE RESPECTIVE PRAXEOLOGICAL TRADITIONS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. YET MORE AND MORE RESEARCHERS ARE WILLING TO OPEN UP TOWARDS TRULY TRANSDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIONS, TRYING TO EXPLOIT ADVANCED METHODS FROM CL WITHIN RESEARCH THAT ULTIMATELY ADDRESSES QUESTIONS FROM THE TRADITIONAL HUMANITIES DISCIPLINES AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES TWO CENTRAL WORKFLOW-RELATED ISSUES FOR THIS TYPE OF COLLABORATIVE PROJECT IN THE DIGITAL HUMANITIES (DH) AND COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE: (1) A SCHEDULING DILEMMA, WHICH AFFECTS THE POINT IN THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT WHEN SPECIFICATIONS OF THE CORE ANALYSIS TASK ARE FIXED (AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE FROM THE COMPUTATIONAL PERSPECTIVE, BUT AS LATE AS POSSIBLE FROM THE HUMANITIES PERSPECTIVE) AND (2) THE SUBJECTIVITY PROBLEM, WHICH CONCERNS THE DEGREE OF INTERSUBJECTIVE STABILITY OF THE TARGET CATEGORIES OF ANALYSIS. CL METHODOLOGY DEMANDS HIGH INTER-ANNOTATOR AGREEMENT AND THEORY-INDEPENDENT CATEGORIES, WHILE THE CATEGORIES IN HERMENEUTIC REASONING ARE OFTEN TIED TO A PARTICULAR INTERPRETIVE APPROACH (VIZ. A THEORY OF LITERARY INTERPRETATION) AND MAY BEAR A NON-TRIVIAL RELATION TO A READER'S PRE-UNDERSTANDING. BUILDING A COMPREHENSIVE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK THAT HELPS OVERCOME THESE ISSUES REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE TIME AND PATIENCE. THE ESTABLISHED COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY HAS TO BE GRADUALLY OPENED UP TO MORE HERMENEUTICALLY ORIENTED RESEARCH QUESTIONS; RESOURCES AND TOOLS FOR THE RELEVANT CATEGORIES OF ANALYSIS HAVE TO BE CONSTRUCTED. THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT CALL INTO QUESTION THAT WELL-TARGETED EFFORTS ALONG THIS PATH ARE WORTHWHILE. YET, IT MAKES THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMATIC POINT REGARDING DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: IT MIGHT BE FRUITFUL TO EXPLORE-IN PARALLEL-THE POTENTIAL LYING IN DH-SPECIFIC VARIANTS OF THE CONCEPT OF RAPID PROTOTYPING FROM SOFTWARE ENGINEERING. TO GET AN IDEA OF HOW COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF SOME ASPECT OF TEXT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO A HERMENEUTIC RESEARCH QUESTION, A PROTOTYPICAL ANALYSIS MODEL IS CONSTRUCTED, E.G., FROM RELATED DATA COLLECTIONS AND ANALYSIS CATEGORIES, USING TRANSFER TECHNIQUES. WHILE THE INITIAL QUALITY OF ANALYSIS MAY BE LIMITED, THE IDEA OF RAPID PROBING ALLOWS SCHOLARS TO EXPLORE HOW THE ANALYSIS FITS IN AN ACTUAL WORKFLOW ON THE TARGET TEXT DATA AND IT CAN THUS PROVIDE EARLY FEEDBACK FOR THE PROCESS OF REFINING THE MODELING. IF THE RAPID PROBING METHOD CAN INDEED BE INCORPORATED IN A HERMENEUTIC FRAMEWORK TO THE SATISFACTION OF WELL-DISPOSED HUMANITIES SCHOLARS, A SWIFTER EXPLORATION OF ALTERNATIVE PATHS OF ANALYSIS WOULD BECOME POSSIBLE. THIS MAY GENERATE CONSIDERABLE ADDITIONAL MOMENTUM FOR TRANSDISCIPLINARY INTEGRATION. IT IS AS YET TOO EARLY TO POINT TO TRULY HUMANITIES-ORIENTED EXAMPLES OF THE PROPOSED RAPID PROBING TECHNIQUE. TO NEVERTHELESS MAKE THE PROGRAMMATIC IDEA MORE CONCRETE, THE ARTICLE USES TWO EXPERIMENTAL SCENARIOS TO ARGUE HOW RAPID PROBING MIGHT HELP ADDRESSING THE SCHEDULING DILEMMA AND THE SUBJECTIVITY PROBLEM RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRST SCENARIO ILLUSTRATES THE TRANSFER OF COMPLEX ANALYSIS PIPELINES ACROSS CORPORA; THE SECOND ONE ADDRESSES RAPID ANNOTATION EXPERIMENTS TARGETING CHARACTER MENTIONS IN LITERARY TEXT.

BACKGROUND. AGENT-BASED MODELLING IS A NEW METHODOLOGICAL TOOL USED TO STUDY COMPLEX SYSTEMS. RESEARCHERS FROM A MULTITUDE OF DISCIPLINES ARE USING AGENT-BASED MODELS TO ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF PROBLEMS THAT TRANSCEND DISCIPLINARY AND GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES. BECAUSE OF THE GROWING INTEREST IN COMPLEXITY SCIENCE IN THE DISCIPLINE OF NURSING, THIS NEW TOOL MAY PROVE USEFUL FOR NURSES ENGAGED IN RESEARCH AND THEORY DEVELOPMENT. DATA SOURCES. ELECTRONIC INDEXES AND ITERATIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHES WERE USED TO IDENTIFY PAPERS, BOOKS AND ABSTRACTS ADDRESSING AGENT-BASED MODELLING. IN ORDER TO TRACE THE EMERGENCE OF THE TOPIC IN THE LITERATURE, DATE LIMITING PARAMETERS WERE NOT USED. SELECTED STUDIES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE WERE LIMITED TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE REPORTS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. THE WORK WAS COMPLETED IN 2008. DISCUSSION. RECURRENT THEMES CONCERNING THE USE OF AGENT-BASE MODELLING INCLUDE HETEROGENEITY, DYNAMICS, ADAPTION, EMERGENCE AND 'BRIDGING'. THE THEMES WERE CONGRUENT WITH PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS AND METANARRATIVES IN NURSING. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING. AGENT-BASED MODELS OFFER PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES IN THE PURSUIT OF NEW KNOWLEDGE, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO PILOT RESEARCH STUDIES USING SIMULATION OR TO VISUALIZE POTENTIAL PRACTICE CHANGES PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION. CONCLUSION. THE USE OF AGENT-BASED MODELLING AS TOOL FOR NURSING THEORY DEVELOPMENT, SHOULD BE EXPANDED.

IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL WEAKLY SUPERVISED PROBABILISTIC TOPIC MODEL, JOINT ISSUE-SENTIMENT-STANCE TOPIC (JISST) MODEL, FOR STANCE DETECTION FROM POLITICAL OPINION IN SOCIAL MEDIA. THE MODEL AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFIES THE TARGET ISSUE AND STANCE TOWARD THE TARGET ISSUE SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM THE TEXT. UNLIKE OTHER MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES TO STANCE CLASSIFICATION WHICH REQUIRE LABELLED DATA FOR TRAINING CLASSIFIERS, JISST REQUIRES ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF SEED WORDS FOR EACH ISSUE AND STANCE AND A SENTIMENT LEXICON. THE MODEL IS EVALUATED ON TWO DATASETS IN THE POLITICAL DOMAIN: A FACEBOOK DATASET WHICH CONTAINS POSTS OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED FACEBOOK GROUPS IN AUSTRALIA AND A TWITTER DATASET WHICH WAS PUBLISHED FOR THE SEMEVAL 2016 COMPETITION.

WE IDENTIFIED BIASES TOWARD US CONTEXT (59%), TWITTER DATA (43%) AND MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH (33%). RESEARCH COVERS DIFFERENT LAYERS OF THE POLITICAL PUBLIC SPHERE (POLITICIANS, EXPERTS, MEDIA, OR THE LAY PUBLIC), HOWEVER, VERY FEW STUDIES INVOLVED MORE THAN ONE LAYER. RESULTS INDICATE THAT ONLY A FEW STUDIES MADE USE OF DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AND A HIGH PROPORTION OF THE STUDIES WERE NOT INTERDISCIPLINARY. THOSE STUDIES THAT MADE EFFORTS TO INTERPRET THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF POLITICAL TEXTS DEPEND NOT ONLY ON THE POLITICAL POSITION OF THEIR AUTHORS, BUT ALSO ON OTHER OFTEN-OVERLOOKED FACTORS. IGNORING THESE FACTORS MAY LEAD TO OVERLY OPTIMISTIC PERFORMANCE MEASURES. ALSO, SPURIOUS RESULTS MAY BE OBTAINED WHEN CAUSAL RELATIONS ARE INFERRED FROM TEXTUAL DATA.

THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH IN SOCIAL SCIENCE TO ADDRESS THIS RETRIEVAL TASK IS TO APPLY A SET OF KEYWORDS AND TO CONSIDER THOSE DOCUMENTS TO BE RELEVANT THAT CONTAIN AT LEAST ONE OF THE KEYWORDS. BUT THE APPLICATION OF INCOMPLETE KEYWORD LISTS HAS A HIGH RISK OF DRAWING BIASED INFERENCES. MORE COMPLEX AND COSTLY METHODS SUCH AS QUERY EXPANSION TECHNIQUES, TOPIC MODEL-BASED CLASSIFICATION RULES, AND ACTIVE AS WELL AS PASSIVE SUPERVISED LEARNING COULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MORE ACCURATELY SEPARATE RELEVANT FROM IRRELEVANT DOCUMENTS AND THEREBY REDUCE THE POTENTIAL SIZE OF BIAS. YET, WHETHER APPLYING THESE MORE EXPENSIVE APPROACHES INCREASES RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO KEYWORD LISTS AT ALL, AND IF SO, BY HOW MUCH, IS UNCLEAR AS A COMPARISON OF THESE APPROACHES IS LACKING. THIS STUDY CLOSES THIS GAP BY COMPARING THESE METHODS ACROSS THREE RETRIEVAL TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH A DATA SET OF GERMAN TWEETS (LINDER IN SSRN, 2017. ), THE SOCIAL BIAS INFERENCE CORPUS (SBIC) (SAP ET AL.

WHILE MOST OF THEM FOCUSED ON THE OFFLINE-ONLINE FLOW, THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINES AGENDA-SETTING WITHIN THE NEW ONLINE PLATFORMS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, THUS ALLOWING FOR CROSS-COUNTRY AND CROSS-MEDIA COMPARISONS. WE APPLIED TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS TO NEW ONLINE MEDIA AND TO TRADITIONAL ONLINE MEDIA SAMPLES IN THE CONTEXT OF EDWARD SNOWDEN'S NSA REVELATIONS. OUR FINDINGS OF INTERMEDIA AGENDA-SETTING EFFECTS SHOW A MODERATE BUT CONSISTENT FLOW FROM NEW ONLINE MEDIA TO TRADITIONAL ONLINE MEDIA. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING THESE NEW DIRECTIONS OF AGENDA FLOW. APART FROM THAT, NO PROFOUND AGENDA-SETTING PATTERNS CAN BE FOUND ELSEWHERE.

THE STUDY WAS INTENDED TO EXPLORE THE PERCEPTION AND EMOTIONS OF THE INDIANS CITIZENS TOWARD COVID-19 VACCINE FROM TWITTER MESSAGES. THE TWEETS WERE COLLECTED FOR THE PERIOD OF 6 MONTHS, FROM MID-JANUARY TO JUNE, 2021 USING HASH-TAGS AND KEYWORDS SPECIFIC TO INDIA. TOPICS AND EMOTIONS FROM THE TWEETS WERE EXTRACTED USING LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA) METHOD AND NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (NRC) LEXICON, RESPECTIVELY. THEME, SENTIMENT AND EMOTION WISE ENGAGEMENT AND REACHABILITY METRICS WERE ASSESSED. HASH-TAG FREQUENCY OF COVID-19 VACCINE BRANDS WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED. INFORMATION REGARDING 'CO-WIN APP AND AVAILABILITY OF VACCINE' WAS WIDELY DISCUSSED AND ALSO RECEIVED HIGHEST ENGAGEMENT AND REACHABILITY AMONG TWITTER USERS. AMONG THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS, TRUST WAS EXPRESSED THE MOST, WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE ACCEPTANCE OF VACCINES AMONG THE INDIAN CITIZENS. THE HASH-TAGS FREQUENCY OF VACCINE BRANDS SHOWS THAT COVISHIELD WAS POPULAR IN THE MONTH OF MARCH 2021, AND COVAXIN IN APRIL 2021. THE RESULTS FROM THE STUDY WILL HELP STAKEHOLDERS TO EFFICIENTLY USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO DISSEMINATE COVID-19 VACCINE INFORMATION ON POPULAR CONCERNS. THIS IN TURN WILL ENCOURAGE CITIZENS TO BE VACCINATED AND ACHIEVE HERD IMMUNITY.

THEREFORE, RANDOM FOREST MODELS AND OTHER MACHINE LEARNING METHODS CAN BE USEFUL FOR IMPROVING THE PREDICTIVE ACCURACY OF MIGRATION MODELS AND IDENTIFYING PATTERNS IN COMPLEX SOCIAL DATASETS.

IT PREDICTS INDIVIDUAL EMOTIONS FROM SENSOR DATA COLLECTED BY AN ANDROID WEAR SMARTWATCH, SUCH AS ACCELERATION, HEARTBEAT, AND ACTIVITY. THE HAPPIMETER WAS USED OVER THREE MONTHS IN THE INNOVATION LAB OF A BANK WITH 22 EMPLOYEES TO MEASURE INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS, ACTIVITY, AND STRESS. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO AN EXPERIMENTAL AND A CONTROL GROUP OF SIMILAR SIZE. BOTH GROUPS WORE THE WATCH AND ENTERED THEIR SUBJECTIVE HAPPINESS, ACTIVITY AND STRESS LEVELS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. THE USER-ENTERED RATINGS WERE THEN USED TO TRAIN A MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM USING THE SENSORS OF THE SMARTWATCH TO SUBSEQUENTLY AUTOMATICALLY PREDICT HAPPINESS, ACTIVITY, AND STRESS. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED ONGOING FEEDBACK ABOUT THEIR MOOD AND WHICH ACTIVITY, SENSOR SIGNALS, OR OTHER PEOPLE, MADE THEM HAPPIER OR UNHAPPIER, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT GET ANY FEEDBACK ABOUT THEIR PREDICTED AND MANUALLY ENTERED EMOTIONS. JUST LIKE IN QUANTUM PHYSICS WE OBSERVED A ""HEISENBERG EFFECT"", WHERE THE PARTICIPANTS MADE AWARE OF THEIR MEASUREMENTS CHANGED THEIR BEHAVIOR: MEMBERS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP THAT RECEIVED HAPPINESS FEEDBACK WERE 16% HAPPIER, AND 26% MORE ACTIVE THAN THE CONTROL GROUP AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT.

AN AGENT-BASED MODEL OF INTERACTION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS BELONGING TO DIFFERENT GROUPS IS PRESENTED. AN AGENT'S DECISION TO COOPERATE OR DEFECT IN A PRISONERS' DILEMMA GAME IS BASED ON THE IDENTITY OF THE OTHERS ALONG TWO IDENTITY DIMENSIONS.

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT IN THE PRESENCE OF CROSS-CUTTING IDENTITY DIMENSIONS, COOPERATION TAKES PLACE NOT ONLY WITHIN CLUSTERS OF IDENTICAL INDIVIDUALS, AS SUGGESTED BY PREVIOUS MODELS, BUT ALSO ALONG EACH OF THE TWO IDENTITY DIMENSIONS, BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS THAT SHARE ONLY ONE OF THE TWO IDENTITY TRAITS. AS THE RELATIVE SALIENCE OF ONE IDENTITY DIMENSION INCREASES, COOPERATING ALONG THE LINES OF THE MORE SALIENT DIMENSION BECOMES THE MOST SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY.

WITH THE INCREASING POPULARITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND DUE TO THE ANONYMITY PROVIDED BY SOME OF THESE PLATFORMS, PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE SHARING DESCRIPTIONS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS IN SOCIAL MEDIA. THE CONTENT GENERATED IN THESE PLATFORMS CAN BE USEFUL IN IDENTIFYING IPV AND CHARACTERIZING THE PREVALENCE, CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES, AND CORRELATES OF IPV IN BROAD POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, THESE DESCRIPTIONS ARE IN THE FORM OF FREE TEXT AND NO CORPUS OF LABELED DATA IS AVAILABLE TO PERFORM LARGE-SCALE COMPUTATIONAL AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES.

USING DETECTIPV, WE COMPREHENSIVELY CHARACTERIZE THE PREDICTABILITY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF VIOLENCE (PHYSICAL ABUSE, EMOTIONAL ABUSE, SEXUAL ABUSE) FROM FREE TEXT. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT A GENERAL MODEL THAT IS TRAINED USING EXAMPLES OF ALL VIOLENCE TYPES CAN IDENTIFY IPV FROM FREE TEXT WITH AREA UNDER THE ROC CURVE (AUROC) 89%. WE ALSO TRAIN TYPE-SPECIFIC MODELS AND OBSERVE THAT PHYSICAL ABUSE CAN BE IDENTIFIED WITH GREATEST ACCURACY (AUROC 98%), WHILE SEXUAL ABUSE CAN BE IDENTIFIED WITH HIGH PRECISION BUT RELATIVELY LOW RECALL. WHILE OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE PREDICTION OF EMOTIONAL ABUSE IS THE MOST CHALLENGING, DETECTIPV CAN IDENTIFY EMOTIONAL ABUSE WITH AUROC ABOVE 80%.

WE OPERATIONALISE THIS IDEA BY DEVELOPING A NOVEL TEXT DISTANCE METRIC, THE TIME-SENSITIVE SEMANTIC EDIT DISTANCE (T-SED), WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE TEMPORAL CONTEXT ACROSS MULTIPLE TRACES. TO EVALUATE THIS METHOD, WE UNDERTAKE A CASE STUDY OF RUSSIAN ONLINE-TROLL ACTIVITY WITHIN US POLITICAL DISCOURSE. THE NOVEL METRIC ALLOWS US TO CLASSIFY THE SOCIAL ROLES OF TROLLS BASED ON THEIR TRACES, IN THIS CASE TWEETS, INTO ONE OF THE PREDEFINED CATEGORIES LEFT-LEANING, RIGHT-LEANING, AND NEWS FEED. WE SHOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE T-SED METRIC TO MEASURE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN TWEETS WHILE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TEMPORAL CONTEXT, AND WE USE NOVEL DATA VISUALISATION TECHNIQUES AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS TO UNCOVER NEW EMPIRICAL INSIGHTS INTO RUSSIAN TROLL ACTIVITY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS WORK. IN ADDITION, WE HIGHLIGHT A CONNECTION WITH THE FIELD OF ACTOR-NETWORK THEORY AND THE RELATED HYPOTHESES OF GABRIEL TARDE, AND WE DISCUSS HOW SOCIAL SEQUENCE ANALYSIS USING T-SED MAY PROVIDE NEW AVENUES FOR TACKLING A LONGSTANDING PROBLEM IN SOCIAL THEORY: HOW TO ANALYSE SOCIETY WITHOUT SEPARATING REALITY INTO MICRO VS.

SINCE ANTI-VACCINE ARTICLES' THEMES AND PERSUASIVE STRATEGIES CHANGE FAST, THEIR EFFECTS ON VIEWERS' BEHAVIORS MAY CHANGE OVER TIME. THIS STUDY EXAMINED HOW PRO- AND ANTI-VACCINE TOPICS AND PUBLIC INTERESTS HAVE CHANGED FROM 2007 TO 2017. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS (E.G., TOPIC MODELING) WERE USED TO ANALYZE 923 ONLINE VACCINE ARTICLES AND OVER 4 MILLION SHARES, REACTIONS, AND COMMENTS THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. PRO-VACCINE MESSAGES (PVMS) THAT USED PERSONAL STORIES RECEIVED THE MOST HEATED DISCUSSION ONLINE AND PURE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE RECEIVED THE LEAST ATTENTION. PVMS THAT PRESENT VACCINE DISAGREEMENTS AND LIMITATIONS WERE NOT POPULAR. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THE IMPORTANCE OF NARRATIVES AND DIRECTLY ATTACKING OPPOSING ARGUMENTS IN HEALTH MESSAGE DESIGN. ANTI-VACCINE MESSAGES (AVMS) THAT DISCUSSED FLU SHOTS AND GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY RECEIVED THE MOST ATTENTION. SINCE APRIL 2015, EVEN THOUGH MORE PVMS APPEARED ONLINE, AVMS, ESPECIALLY THOSE ABOUT VACCINE DAMAGE, WERE INCREASINGLY MORE POPULAR THAN PVMS. SOME SOCIAL EVENTS AND DISEASE OUTBREAKS MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE POPULARITY OF AVMS. NEWLY EMERGED ANTI-VACCINE TOPICS (E.G., FALSE RUMORS OF CDC CONSPIRACY) SHOULD BE NOTED. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT CERTAIN TOPICS CAN BE MORE POPULAR ONLINE AND CAN POTENTIALLY REACH A LARGER POPULATION. IT ALSO REVEALS THE EVOLUTION OF VACCINE-RELATED TOPICS AND PUBLIC'S INTEREST.

WITH THE EXPONENTIALLY INCREASING CRIME RATE, IT HAS BECOME A DAUNTING TASK TO PREVENT THEM AT AN EVENLY FASTER RATE. THEREFORE, WE HAVE WORKED WITH SEVERAL VARIABLES THAT ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED WITH ADOLESCENT OFFENSES. THE STUDY IDENTIFIES THE CAUSES OF ADOLESCENT DRUG ADDICTION BY PINPOINTING THE BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS AND PREDICTS THEIR TENDENCY OF CRIME ENGAGEMENT. USING A DATASET OF BOTH DRUG-ADDICTED AND NON-ADDICTED TEENS, THE PROPOSED APPROACH PREDICTS THE LATENT CONNECTIONS TO FUTURE UNDER-AGED CRIMES. THE DATASET WAS COLLECTED FROM FOUR DRUG REHABILITATION CENTERS AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. TO ACHIEVE BETTER PREDICTION, WE HAVE USED MULTIPLE MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS LOGISTIC REGRESSION, K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR (KNN), SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), RANDOM FOREST, XGBOOST, AND MULTILAYER PERCEPTRONS (MLPS). WE HAVE EVALUATED SEVERAL PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS, NAMELY ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1 SCORE, AND COMPARED THEM IN LIGHT OF INDIVIDUAL ALGORITHMS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT MLPS ALGORITHM OUTPERFORMED OTHERS ATTAINING 95.36% ACCURACY, WHEREAS OTHER ALGORITHMS ACHIEVED ACCURACIES RANGING FROM 89 TO 94%. WE HAVE ALSO EXTRACTED THE BEST FEATURES BY APPLYING UNIVARIATE FEATURE SELECTION METHOD AND RECURSIVE FEATURE ELIMINATION (RFE) METHOD.

QUANTIFYING GLOBAL MIGRATION IS, HOWEVER, CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF POOR RECORDING, PRIVACY ISSUES AND RESIDENCE STATUS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL FOR SOME CLASSES OF MIGRANTS INVOLVED IN STIGMATISED, UNREGULATED OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. ESCORTING SERVICES OR HIGH-END PROSTITUTION ARE WELL-PAID ACTIVITIES THAT ATTRACT WORKERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS PAPER, WE STUDY INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION PATTERNS OF SEX-WORKERS BY USING NETWORK METHODS. USING AN EXTENSIVE INTERNATIONAL ONLINE ADVERTISEMENT DIRECTORY OF ESCORTING SERVICES AND INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUAL ESCORTS, WE RECONSTRUCT A MIGRANT FLOW NETWORK WHERE NODES REPRESENT EITHER ORIGIN OR DESTINATION COUNTRIES. THE LINKS REPRESENT THE DIRECT ROUTES BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES. THE MIGRATION NETWORK OF SEX-WORKERS SHOWS DIFFERENT STRUCTURAL PATTERNS THAN THE MIGRATION OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE NETWORK CONTAINS A STRONG CORE WHERE MUTUAL MIGRATION IS OFTEN OBSERVED BETWEEN A GROUP OF HIGH-INCOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, YET EUROPE IS SPLIT INTO DIFFERENT NETWORK COMMUNITIES WITH SPECIFIC TIES TO NON-EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. WE FIND NON-RECIPROCAL RELATIONS BETWEEN COUNTRIES, WITH SOME OF THEM MOSTLY OFFERING WHILE OTHERS ATTRACT WORKERS. THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA (GDPC) IS A GOOD INDICATOR OF COUNTRY ATTRACTIVENESS FOR INCOMING WORKERS AND SERVICE RATES BUT IS UNRELATED TO THE PROBABILITY OF EMIGRATION. THE MEDIAN FINANCIAL GAIN OF MIGRATING, IN COMPARISON TO WORKING AT THE HOME COUNTRY, IS 15.9%. ONLY SEX-WORKERS COMING FROM 77% OF THE COUNTRIES HAVE FINANCIAL GAINS WITH MIGRATION AND AVERAGE GAINS DECREASE WITH THE GDPC OF THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN.

WE USE A MODEL OF A SIMPLE PASTORALIST SOCIETY IN A WORLD WITHOUT BORDERS TO MIGRATION BY ADDING THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPERIENCING THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL STRUCTURES (SUCH AS FAMILY AND FRIENDS) AND TECHNOLOGICAL NETWORKS (E.G., SOCIAL MEDIA). IT APPEARS OBVIOUS THAT PASTORALIST MOBILITY DEPENDS ON OTHER DIMENSIONS AS LAND TENURE AND TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE; HOWEVER, ISOLATING THESE TWO EFFECTS AND EXPERIMENTING IN A SIMPLE SOCIETY ALLOW US TO FILTER THE MULTIDIMENSIONALITY OF MOBILITY DECISIONS AND CONCENTRATE ON COMPARING SCENARIOS IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT SOCIAL STRUCTURES AND TECHNOLOGICAL NETWORK COMBINATIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW AN EXPECTED BEHAVIOR OF MORE CONNECTION AND MORE MOBILITY, AND A NON-LINEAR EMERGENT BEHAVIOR WHERE PASTORALISTS WAIT FOR A LONGER AMOUNT OF TIME TO MOBILIZE WHEN THEY INTERACT USING POWERFUL SOCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL NETWORKS. THIS OCCURS UNTIL THEY DECIDE TO MOVE, AND THEN, THEY MOBILIZE MORE QUICKLY AND STRONGLY THAN THEY DID WHEN COMMUNICATION WAS NON-EXISTENT BETWEEN THEM.

WHILE THERE IS A CLEAR OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THIS RESEARCH USING COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH, THE FIELD LACKS PRACTICAL AGREEMENTS ON HOW TO RECONCILE METHODOLOGICAL TENSIONS BETWEEN NORMS AND STANDARDS OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO START ESTABLISHING METHODOLOGICAL STANDARDS FOR SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH USING LARGE MEDIA COVERAGE DATA ACROSS MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS. WE POSE THREE KEY QUESTIONS: WHEN IS THE COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH EFFECTIVE IN ASSESSING MEDIA COVERAGE OF ORGANIZATIONS? WHAT ARE PRACTICAL CHALLENGES THAT SOCIAL SCIENTISTS FACE WHILE USING THE COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH TO STUDYING THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF ORGANIZATIONS? HOW EFFECTIVELY DOES A COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH PERFORM TO MEASURE THE MAJOR MEDIA VARIABLES OF VOLUME AND SENTIMENT? WE START BY SUGGESTING THAT THIS APPROACH IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL WHEN THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF ORGANIZATIONS EITHER ENTAILS CONTEXT-DEPENDENCE OR INVOLVES A RARE PHENOMENON. WE THEN FOCUS ON DEMONSTRATING A REPLICABLE COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY. WE DETAIL DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS FOR STUDYING THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF 10,749 VENTURE-CAPITAL-BACKED STARTUP COMPANIES IN THE U.S. FROM 1980 TO 2018, USING 745,216 UNIQUE ARTICLES. THE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF MEDIA VOLUME IS HIGHLY VALID AND PROVIDES VALUABLE INSIGHTS FOR SOCIAL SCIENTISTS. IN CONTRAST, USING POPULAR DICTIONARIES TO ANALYZE MEDIA SENTIMENT ACROSS MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS IS PROBLEMATIC, SUGGESTING THE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW METHODOLOGIES. WE CONCLUDE THAT SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AND COMPUTER SCIENTISTS SHOULD PROACTIVELY COLLABORATE TO CREATE TOOLS TO ADVANCE FUTURE RESEARCH IN THIS DOMAIN.

HOWEVER, THE UTILIZATION OF GEO-LOCATED DATA IS A CHALLENGING TASK, BOTH IN TERMS OF DATA MANAGEMENT AND IN TERMS OF KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION, WHICH REQUIRES A HOLISTIC APPROACH. IN THIS PAPER, WE IMPLEMENT AN INTEGRATED KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN CYBERSPACE FRAMEWORK FOR RETRIEVING, PROCESSING AND INTERPRETING TWITTER GEOLOCATED DATA FOR THE DISCOVERY AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE LATENT OPINION IN USER-GENERATED DEBATES ON THE INTERNET. TEXT MINING TECHNIQUES, SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND A CLUSTER SPATIAL DETECTION TECHNIQUE ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR RESEARCH FRAMEWORK. AS REAL-WORD EXAMPLE, WE FOCUS ON TWITTER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT BREXIT, POSTED ON UK DURING THE 13 MONTHS BEFORE THE BREXIT DAY. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, BASED ON VARIOUS ANALYSIS OF BREXIT-RELATED TWEETS, DEMONSTRATE THAT DIFFERENT SPATIAL PATTERNS CAN BE IDENTIFIED, CLEARLY DISTINGUISHING PRO- AND ANTI-BREXIT ENCLAVES AND DELINEATING INTERESTING BREXIT GEOGRAPHIES.

OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO CHARACTERIZE COMMON CYBERBEHAVIORS AND SHARED FOLLOWER NETWORKS AMONG DISPENSARIES OPERATING IN TWO LARGE CANNABIS MARKETS IN CALIFORNIA. METHODS: FROM A TARGETED SAMPLE OF 119 DISPENSARIES IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND GREATER LOS ANGELES, WE COLLECTED METADATA FROM THE DISPENSARY ACCOUNTS USING THE TWITTER API. FOR EACH CITY, WE CHARACTERIZED THE NETWORK STRUCTURE OF DISPENSARIES BASED UPON SHARED FOLLOWERS, THEN EMPIRICALLY DERIVED COMMUNITIES WITH THE LOUVAIN MODULARITY ALGORITHM. PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS FACTOR ANALYSIS WAS EMPLOYED TO REDUCE 12 TWITTER MEASURES INTO A MORE PARSIMONIOUS SET OF CYBERBEHAVIORAL DIMENSIONS. FINALLY, QUADRATIC DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS WAS IMPLEMENTED TO VERIFY THE ABILITY OF THE EXTRACTED DIMENSIONS TO CLASSIFY DISPENSARIES INTO THEIR DERIVED COMMUNITIES. RESULTS: THE MODULARITY ALGORITHM YIELDED THREE COMMUNITIES IN EACH CITY WITH DISTINCT NETWORK STRUCTURES. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS FACTOR ANALYSIS REDUCED THE 12 CYBERBEHAVIORS INTO FIVE DIMENSIONS THAT ENCOMPASSED ACCOUNT AGE, POSTING FREQUENCY, REFERENCING, HYPERLINKS, AND USER ENGAGEMENT AMONG THE DISPENSARY ACCOUNTS.

IN HIERARCHICAL GROUPS, MONITORING AND PUNISHMENT ARE ORGANIZED INTO TREE-LIKE COMMAND-AND-CONTROL STRUCTURES WITH SUPERVISORS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE COOPERATION OF THEIR SUBORDINATES AND PUNISHING NON-COOPERATORS. BY CONTRAST, IN DISTRIBUTED GROUPS, MONITORING IS DIFFUSE AND PUNISHMENT IS COLLECTIVE. I PROPOSE THAT THE ORGANIZATION OF COOPERATIVE HUMAN GROUPS IS CONSTRAINED BY THE COSTS OF MONITORING AND PUNISHMENT. I FORMALIZE THIS HYPOTHESIS WITH A MODEL WHERE INDIVIDUALS IN A GROUP COOPERATE TO PRODUCE PUBLIC GOODS WHILE EMBEDDED IN A NETWORK OF MONITORING AND PUNISHMENT RESPONSIBILITIES. I SHOW THAT, WHEN PUNISHMENT COSTS ARE HIGH AND MONITORING COSTS ARE LOW, SOCIALLY-OPTIMAL MONITORING AND PUNISHMENT NETWORKS ARE DISTRIBUTED.

USING A TWITTER FIELD SURVEY, WE MEASURED AUTHORS' MORAL OUTRAGE IN REAL TIME AND COMPARED AUTHORS' REPORTS TO OBSERVERS' JUDGEMENTS OF THE AUTHORS' MORAL OUTRAGE. WE FIND THAT OBSERVERS SYSTEMATICALLY OVERPERCEIVE MORAL OUTRAGE IN AUTHORS, INFERRING MORE INTENSE MORAL OUTRAGE EXPERIENCES FROM MESSAGES THAN THE AUTHORS OF THOSE MESSAGES ACTUALLY REPORTED. THIS EFFECT WAS STRONGER IN PARTICIPANTS WHO SPENT MORE TIME ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO LEARN ABOUT POLITICS. PREREGISTERED CONFIRMATORY BEHAVIOURAL EXPERIMENTS FOUND THAT OVERPERCEPTION OF INDIVIDUALS' MORAL OUTRAGE CAUSES OVERPERCEPTION OF COLLECTIVE MORAL OUTRAGE AND INFLATES BELIEFS ABOUT HOSTILE COMMUNICATION NORMS, GROUP AFFECTIVE POLARIZATION AND IDEOLOGICAL EXTREMITY. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT HOW INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL OVERPERCEPTIONS OF ONLINE MORAL OUTRAGE PRODUCE COLLECTIVE OVERPERCEPTIONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO WARP OUR SOCIAL KNOWLEDGE OF MORAL AND POLITICAL ATTITUDES.

CITATIONS AND TEXT ANALYSIS ARE BOTH USED TO STUDY THE DISTRIBUTION AND FLOW OF IDEAS BETWEEN RESEARCHERS, FIELDS AND COUNTRIES, BUT THE RESULTING FLOWS ARE RARELY EQUAL. WE ARGUE THAT THE DIFFERENCES IN THESE TWO FLOWS CAPTURE A GROWING GLOBAL INEQUALITY IN THE PRODUCTION OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE. WE OFFER A FRAMEWORK CALLED 'CITATIONAL LENSING' TO IDENTIFY WHERE CITATIONS SHOULD APPEAR BETWEEN COUNTRIES BUT ARE ABSENT GIVEN THAT WHAT IS EMBEDDED IN THEIR PUBLISHED ABSTRACT TEXTS IS HIGHLY SIMILAR. THIS FRAMEWORK ALSO IDENTIFIES WHERE CITATIONS ARE OVERABUNDANT GIVEN LOWER SIMILARITY.

THIS SCENARIO IMPLIES THAT A POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP BETWEEN FIRMS AND INVESTORS EXISTS AND MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PREJUDICING THE WAY MANAGEMENT ALLOCATES THEIR RESOURCES, WITH FIRM, AND ECONOMIC, GROWTH ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FURTHER, THERE ARE GROWING REAL-WORLD CONCERNS THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLICLY LISTED FIRMS IS BECOMING TOO CONCERNED WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR FIRM'S SHARE PRICE, WHICH IS ADVERSELY INFLUENCING RESOURCE ALLOCATION DECISIONS. A RELATED CONCERN IS THAT AGENTS, IN GENERAL, WITHIN FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE PLACING A DISPROPORTIONATE FOCUS ON SHORT-TERM FACTORS. TO INVESTIGATE THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE PROPOSED FEEDBACK LOOP ON FIRM GROWTH AND MARKET VOLATILITY, THIS PAPER IMPLEMENTS A NOVEL AGENT-BASED ARTIFICIAL STOCK MARKET WHERE MANAGEMENT CAN CONSIDER THE MOVEMENTS OF THEIR FIRM'S ENDOGENOUSLY DETERMINED SHARE PRICE WHEN ALLOCATING RESOURCES BETWEEN SALES AND MARGIN GROWTH. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT AN INFERIOR OUTCOME REGARDING FIRM GROWTH, AND VARIOUS OTHER FINANCIAL METRICS, IF MANAGEMENT IS OVERLY CONCERNED WITH SHARE PRICE MOVEMENTS. THE GROWTH OF THE FIRMS (AND MARKET) IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE MIXTURE OF THE INVESTOR CLASSES INITIATED DUE TO THE DIVERGENT LEVELS OF VOLATILITY THEY CREATE. ADDITIONALLY, THE MODEL PRESENTS INSIGHTS INTO HOW AND WHY THE EXTENT TO WHICH AGENTS CONSIDER PAST OUTCOMES IN THEIR DECISION-MAKING PROCESS BECOMES INFLUENTIAL. NOTABLY, THE MODEL'S RESULTS EMULATE AN EXTENSIVE SET OF GLOBAL MICRO-LEVEL FIRM DATA.

ONLINE DATING PRESENTS A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS PUZZLE. IN THIS PAPER, I USE BEHAVIORAL DATA FROM A POPULAR ONLINE DATING SITE TO ANSWER THREE QUESTIONS REGARDING PREFERENCES IN THE EARLY STAGES OF MATE CHOICE: FIRST, TO WHAT EXTENT DO PEOPLE PREFER SIMILARITY VERSUS STATUS IN A PARTNER-AND DO THESE PREFERENCES VARY BY GENDER? SECOND, WHAT IS THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PREFERENCES-AND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE APPARENT PREFERENCES FOR ONE CHARACTERISTIC MERELY A ""BY-PRODUCT"" OF PREFERENCES FOR ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC WITH WHICH THE FIRST IS CORRELATED?

THE AUTHORS PROPOSE A NETWORK APPROACH TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. THE APPROACH CONCEPTUALIZES THE OCCUPATIONAL SYSTEM AS A NETWORK, IN WHICH THE NODES ARE OCCUPATIONS AND THE EDGES ARE DEFINED BY THE VOLUME AND DIRECTION OF WORKERS WHO MOVE BETWEEN THE NODES. A FLOW-BASED COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHM IS INTRODUCED TO UNCOVER MOBILITY BOUNDARIES BASED ON THE OBSERVED MOBILITY NETWORK. APPLYING THIS APPROACH TO ANALYZE TRENDS IN INTRAGENERATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL MOBILITY IN THE UNITED STATES FROM 1989 TO 2015, THE AUTHORS FIND THAT THE BOUNDARIES THAT CONSTRAIN MOBILITY OPPORTUNITIES HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY RIGID OVER TIME, WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, DECOUPLED FROM THE BOUNDARIES OF BIG CLASSES AND MICROCLASSES. MOREOVER, THESE BOUNDARIES ARE INCREASINGLY SORTING WORKERS INTO CLUSTERS OF OCCUPATIONS WITH SIMILAR SKILL REQUIREMENTS. NA 756"
